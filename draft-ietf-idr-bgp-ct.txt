                     BGP Classful Transport Planes
                        draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ct-11

Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "Intent Driven
   Service Mapping", that uses BGP to express intent based association
   of overlay routes, with underlay routes having specific Traffic
   Engineering (TE) characteristics, that satisfy a certain Service
   Level Agreement (SLA).  The document achieves this by defining new
   constructs, to group underlay routes with sufficienty similar TE
   characteristics into identifiable classes (Transport Class), that
   overlay routes use as an ordered set to resolve reachability
   (Resolution Scheme) towards service endpoints.  These constructs can
   be used to realize the "IETF Network Slice" defined in TEAS Network
   Slices framework.

   This document specifies protocol procedures for BGP that enable
   dissemination of such service mapping information in a network that
   may span multiple cooperating administrative domains.  These domains
   may be administered either by the same provider or by closely
   coordinating providers.  A new BGP address family that leverages
   RFC-4364 procedures and follows RFC-8277 NLRI encoding, is defined to
   advertise underlay routes with its identified class.  This new
   address family is called "BGP Classful Transport", a.k.a., BGP CT.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


1.  Introduction

   Provider networks, typically span across multiple domains where, each
   domain can either represent an Autonomous system (AS) or an Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) region within an AS.  In these networks,
   several services are provisioned between different pairs of service
   endpoints (e.g.  Provider Edge nodes), that can either be in the same
   domain or across different domains.

   This document realizes "Intent" as defined in [RFC9315] and
   prescribes constructs and procedures that enable provider networks to
   be able to forward service traffic based on service specific intent,
   end-to-end across service endpoints.

   The mechanisms described in this document achieve "Intent Driven
   Service Mapping" between any pair of service endpoints by

      Provisioning end-to-end "intent-aware" paths (e.g. low latency
      path, best effort path) using BGP,

      Expressing a desired intent (e.g use low latency path with
      fallback to best effort path), and

      Forwarding service traffic "only" using end-to-end "intent-aware"
      paths honoring that desired intent.

   The constructs and procedures defined in this document apply
   homogenously to Intra-AS as well as Inter-AS Option-A, Option-B and
   Option-C style deployments in provider networks.

   Provider networks that are deployed using such styles, provision
   intra-domain transport tunnels between a pair of endpoints, typically
   a service node or a border node, that service traffic use to traverse
   that domain.  These tunnels are signaled using various tunneling
   protocols depending on the forwarding architecture of the domain,
   which can be Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet Protocol
   (IP) or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

   The mechanisms defined in this document are agnostic to any tunneling
   protocol.  These can be applied homogenously to intra-domain
   tunneling technologies used in brownfield networks (e.g.  MPLS
   Traffic Engineering) as well as greenfield networks (e.g.  Segment
   Routing).

   The constructs defined in this document are used to classify and
   group these intra-domain tunnels based on their Traffic Engineering
   (TE) charecteristics (e.g low latency), into identifiable classes,
   thus making them "intent-aware".  These constructs enable services to

   express its desired intent using one or more identifiable classes,
   and to selectively map traffic onto "intent-aware" intra-domain
   tunnels only within the scope of these classes.

   This document introduces a new BGP address family known as "BGP
   Classful Transport" that extends/stitches intent-aware intra-domain
   tunnels that belong to the same class across domain boundaries, to
   establish end-to-end intent-aware paths between service endpoints.

   [Intent-Routing-Color] describes various use cases and applications

   Service Family : BGP address family used for advertising routes for
   "data traffic" as opposed to tunnels (e.g.  SAFI 1 or 128).

   Transport Family : BGP address family used for advertising tunnels,
   which are in turn used by service routes for resolution (e.g.  SAFI 4
   or 76).

   Transport Tunnel : A tunnel over which a service may place traffic
   (e.g.  GRE, UDP, LDP, RSVP-TE, IGP FLEX-ALGO or SRTE).

   Tunnel Ingress Route: Route to Tunnel Destination/Endpoint installed
   at the headend (ingress) of the tunnel by the tunneling protocol.

   Tunnel Domain : A domain of the network containing SNs and BNs under
   a single administrative control that has tunnels between them.  An
   end-to-end tunnel spanning several adjacent tunnel domains can be
   created by "stitching" them together using MPLS labels (or an
   equivalent identifier based on the forwarding architecture).

   Transport Class : A construct to group transport tunnels offering the
   same SLA.

   Transport Class RT : A Route-Target extended community used to
   identify a specific Transport Class.

   Transport Route Database (TRDB): At the SN and BN, a Transport Class
   has an associated Transport Route Database that collects its tunnel
   ingress routes.

   Resolution Scheme: A construct comprising of an ordered set of TRDBs
   to resolve next hop reachability, for realizing a desired Intent.

   Mapping Community : Any BGP Community/Extended-community on a BGP
   route that maps to a Resolution Scheme.  E.g. color:0:100, transport-
   target:0:100.

   Transport Plane : An end to end plane consisting of transport tunnels
   belonging to the same Transport Class.  Tunnels of the same Transport
   Class are stitched together by BGP CT route readvertisements with
   next hop self to enable Label-Swap forwarding across domain
   boundaries.

3.  Architecture Overview

   This document defines "Transport Class" (Section 4) and "Resolution
   Scheme" (Section 5) as constructs to achieve end-to-end "Intent
   Driven Service Mapping".

   The tunneling protocols are made "Transport Class" aware.  They
   publish their underlay routes for a Transport Class into an
   associated "Transport Route Database" (TRDB) (Section 4.2).  These
   underlay routes are used to resolve overlay BGP routes.  How exactly
   these intra-domain tunneling protocols are made Transport Class
   aware, is outside the scope of this document.

   The underlay route in a TRDB can be advertised in BGP to extend an
   underlay tunnel to adjacent domains.  A new BGP transport layer
   address family called "BGP Classful Transport", aka BGP CT (SAFI 76)
   is defined for this purpose.  BGP CT makes it possible to advertise
   multiple tunnels to the same destination address, thus avoiding need
   of multiple loopbacks on the egress node.

   BGP CT family carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain
   boundaries (e.g. in Inter-AS Option-C networks), which is parallel to
   BGP LU (SAFI 4).  It disseminates "Transport class" information for
   the transport prefixes across the participating domains, which is not
   possible with BGP LU.  This makes the end-to-end network a "Transport
   Class" aware tunneled network.

   Service overlay routes carry sufficient indication of the desired
   Transport Classes in the form of a BGP community called the "Mapping
   community".  The resolution infrastructure and the procedures for
   "Resolution Scheme" (Section 5) defined in this document enable an
   ingress nodes to resolve overlay routes over the appropriate underlay
   tunnels only within the scope of the Transport Classes identified by
   the Mapping Community.  The ingress node performs a Longest Prefix
   Match (LPM) on the next hop of the overlay route within the TRDBs the
   Reslution Scheme maps to.  If the service overlay route is carried in
   BGP, the Protocol Next Hop (PNH) is carried as an attribute of the
   route.

   The PNH of the overlay route is also referred to as "Service
   Endpoint" (SEP).  The SEP may either be located in the same domain as
   the service ingress node or be located in a different domain, which
   is either adjacent or non-adjacent.  In the former case, reachability
   to a SEP is provided by an intra-domain tunneling protocol and in the
   latter case, reachability to a SEP is via BGP transport families like
   BGP LU (SAFI 4) or BGP CT (SAFI 76).

   This document in essence, describes mechanisms to:

      Model a "Transport Class" as a "TRDB" on a router and to collect
      tunnel ingress routes of a certain class.

      Enable service overlay routes carrying an appropriate "Mapping
      Community" to resolve its reachability for a SEP within the
      resolution scope (TRDB) of an intended Transport Class.

      Advertise tunnel underlay routes present in a TRDB using BGP
      without any path hiding using BGP VPN and Add-path procedures,
      such that service overlay routes in the receiving domains can also
      resolve over tunnels of the associated Transport Class.

      Provide a way for cooperating domains to reconcile any differences
      in extended community namespaces and interoperate between
      different intra-domain tunneling technologies in each domain.

   This document describes procedures using MPLS forwarding
   architecture.  However, these procedures would work in similar manner
   for non-MPLS forwarding architectures as well.  Section 11 describes
   the application of BGP CT over SRv6 data plane.

4.  Transport Class

   Transport Class is a construct that groups transport tunnels offering
   similar SLA within the administrative domain of a provider network or
   closely coordinated provider networks.  A Transport Class is
   identified by a unique 32-bit "Transport Class" identifier, that is
   assigned by the operator.  This "Transport Class" identifier is
   encoded in the Transport Class RT, which is a new Route Target
   extended community.

   A Transport Class is configured at SNs and BNs with RD and RT
   attributes.  Creation of a Transport Class instantiates its
   corresponding TRDB on that node.

   An operator may configure an SN/BN to classify a tunnel into an
   appropriate Transport Class.  How exactly these tunnels are made
   Transport Class aware is implementation specific and outside the
   scope of this document.  When a tunnel is made Transport Class aware,
   it causes the tunnel's ingress route to be installed in the
   corresponding TRDB of that Transport Class.  These routes are used to
   resolve BGP routes including BGP CT, which may be further
   readvertised to adjacent domains to extend these tunnels.

   Alternatively, a SN/BN receiving the transport routes via BGP with
   sufficient signaling information to identify a Transport Class can
   associate those ingress routes to the corresponding Transport Class.
   E.g. for Classful Transport family (SAFI 76) routes, the Transport
   Class RT indicates the Transport Class.  For BGP LU family (SAFI 4)
   routes, import processing based on Communities or Inter-AS source-
   peer may be used to place the route in the desired Transport Class.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   When the ingress route is received via [SRTE] with "Color:Endpoint"
   as the NLRI that encodes the Transport Class as an integer 'Color',
   the 'Color' is mapped to a Transport Class during the import
   processing.  The SRTE ingress route for this 'Endpoint' is installed
   in the corresponding TRDB.  The SRTE tunnel will be extended by a BGP
   CT advertisement with NLRI 'RD:Endpoint', Transport Class RT and a
   new label.  The MPLS swap route thus installed for the new label will
   pop the label and forward the decapsulated traffic into the path
   determined by the SRTE route for further encapsulation.

   [RFC8664] extends Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (PCEP) to carry SRTE Color.  This color association learnt from PCEP
   is also mapped to a Transport Class thus associating the PCEP driven
   SRTE LSP with the desired Transport Class.

   Similarly, [PCEP-RSVP-COLOR] extends PCEP to carry RSVP Color.  This
   color association learnt from PCEP is also mapped to a Transport
   Class thus associating the PCEP driven RSVP-TE LSP with the desired
   Transport Class.

4.1.  "Transport Class" Route Target Extended Community

   This section defines a new type of Route Target, called "Transport
   Class" Route Target Extended Community.

   "Transport Class" Route Target Extended Community is a transitive
   extended community EXT-COMM [RFC4360] of extended type, which has the
   format as shown in Figure 1.

   This new Route Target Format has the following encoding:

   The VPN route import/export mecahnisms as specified in BGP VPN
   [RFC4364] and the Constrained Route Distribution mechanisms as
   specified in Route Target Constraints [RFC4684] can be applied to BGP
   CT routes using its Transport Class Route Target Extended community.

   A BGP speaker that implements RT Constraint Route Target Constraints
   [RFC4684] MUST apply the RT Constraint procedures to the Transport
   Class Route Target Extended community as well.

   The Transport Class Route Target Extended community is carried on
   Classful Transport family routes and is used to associate them with
   appropriate TRDBs at receiving BGP speakers.

   Defining a new type code for the Transport Class Route Target
   Extended community avoids conflicts with any VPN Route Target
   assignments already in use for service families.

4.2.  Transport Route Database

   A Transport Route Database is a logical collection of transport
   routes pertaining to the same Transport Class.  Tunnel endpoint
   addresses in a TRDB belong to the "Provider Namespace" representing
   the core transport region.

   Overlay routes that require the use of a specific Transport Class
   confine the scope of next hop resolution to the set of routes
   contained in the corresponding TRDB.

   The TRDB can be for e.g., realized as a "Routing Table" referred in
   Section 9.1.2.1 of RFC4271 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc4271#section-9.1.2.1) which is a control plane only database.
   However, an implementation may choose a different methodology to
   realize this logical construct while still adhering with the
   procedures defined in this document.

   SNs or BNs originate routes for 'Classful Transport' address family
   from the TRDB.  These routes have NLRI "RD:Endpoint", Transport Class
   RT and an MPLS label (or an identifier that represents an equivalent
   of a label in a different forwarding archietecture).  'Classful
   Transport' family routes received with Transport Class RT are
   imported into its corresponding TRDB.

5.  Resolution Scheme

   This section defines the Resolution Scheme construct that is used to
   specify how a service route or a BGP CT route can resolve its next
   hop using its associated Mapping Community over a specific TRDB or an
   ordered set of TRDBs.

   An implementation may provide an option for the service route to
   resolve over less preferred Transport Classes, should the resolution
   over a primary Transport Class fail.

   To accomplish this, the set of service routes may be associated with
   a user-configured "Resolution Scheme" that consists of the "Mapping
   Community" and the primary Transport Class, which is used to realize
   the desired intent.  The Resolution Scheme may also be configured to
   include an ordered list of fallback Transport Classes.

   Mapping community is a "role" and not a new type of community; any
   BGP community or extended community may play this role.  A Mapping
   Community maps to exactly one Resolution Scheme.






Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   An example of mapping community is "color:0:100", described in
   [RFC9012], or the "transport-target:0:100" described in Section 4.1
   in this document.

   A BGP route is associated with a resolution scheme during import
   processing.  The first community on the route that matches a Mapping
   Community of a locally configured Resolution Scheme is considered the
   effective Mapping Community for the route.  The Resolution Scheme
   thus found is used when resolving the route's PNH.  If a route
   contains more than one Mapping Community, it indicates that the route
   considers these distinct Mapping Communities as equivalent in Intent.
   So, the first community that maps to a Resolution Scheme is chosen as
   the effective Mapping Community.

   A transport route received in BGP Classful Transport family SHOULD
   use a Resolution Scheme that contains only the primary Transport
   Class without any fallback to best effort tunnels.  The primary
   Transport Class is identified by the Transport Class RT carried on
   the route.  Thus, Transport Class RT serves as the Mapping Community
   for BGP CT routes.

   A service route received in a BGP service family MAY map to any user-
   configured Resolution Scheme that identifies the Mapping Community on
   the route.

6.  BGP Classful Transport Family

   The Classful Transport (CT) family will use the existing Address
   Family Identifier (AFI) of IPv4 or IPv6 and a new SAFI 76 "Classful
   Transport" that will applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 AFIs.  These AFI/
   SAFI pair of values MUST be negotiated as per the Multiprotocol
   Extensions capability described in section 8 of [RFC4760] to be able
   to send and receive BGP CT routes.

   The "Classful Transport" SAFI NLRI has similar encoding as specified
   in section 2 of [RFC8277].

   When AFI/SAFI is 1/76, the Classful Transport NLRI Prefix consists of
   an 8-byte RD followed by an IPv4 prefix.  When AFI/SAFI is 2/76, the
   Classful Transport NLRI Prefix consists of an 8-byte RD followed by
   an IPv6 prefix.

   The procedures described for SAFIs 4 or 128 in section 2 of [RFC8277]
   apply for SAFI 76 as well.  BGP CT routes may carry multiple labels
   in the NLRI, by negotiating the Multiple Labels Capability as
   described in section 2.1 of [RFC8277]

 Length: 1 octet

    This field specifies the length in bits of the remainder of the NLRI field.

    Note that the length will always be the sum of 20 (number of bits
    in Label field), plus 3 (number of bits in Rsrv field), plus 1
    (number of bits in S field), plus the length in bits of the
    Prefix (RD:IP prefix).

    In an MP_REACH_NLRI attribute whose SAFI is 76, the Prefix
    (RD + IP prefix) will be 96 bits or less if the AFI is 1
    and will be 192 bits or less if the AFI is 2.

    As specified in [RFC4760], the actual length of the NLRI field
    will be the number of bits specified in the Length field, rounded
    up to the nearest integral number of octets.

 Label:

     The Label field is a 20-bit field containing an MPLS label value
     (see [RFC3032]).

 Rsrv:

     This 3-bit field SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
     ignored on reception.

     When single label is advertised, this 1-bit field MUST be set to
     one on transmission and MUST be ignored on reception.

 IPv4/IPv6 Prefix:

    IPv4 prefix, if AFI/SAFI 1/76.

   Attributes on a Classful Transport route include the Transport Class
   Route Target extended community, which is used to associate the route
   with the correct TRDBs on SNs and BNs in the network and either an
   IPv4 or an IPv6 next hop.

   When the length of the Next hop Address field is 4 the next hop
   address is of type IPv4 address.

   When the length of Next hop Address field is 16 (or 32) the next hop
   address is of type IPv6 address (potentially followed by the link-
   local IPv6 address of the next hop).

   When the length of Next hop Address field is 24 (or 48) the next hop
   address is of type VPN-IPv6 with an 8-octet RD set to zero
   (potentially followed by the link-local VPN-IPv6 address of the next
   hop with an 8-octet RD set to zero).

   When the length of the Next hop Address field is 12 the next hop
   address is of type VPN-IPv4 with 8-octet RD set to zero.

6.1.  Carrying multiple Encapsulation Information

   To ease interoperability between nodes supporting different
   forwarding technologies, a BGP CT route allows carrying multiple
   encapsulation information.

   An MPLS Label is carried using the encoding in [RFC8277] . A node
   that does not support MPLS forwarding advertises the special label 3
   (Implicit Null) in the RFC 8277 MPLS Label field.

   The SID information for SR with respect to MPLS Data Plane is carried
   as specified in Prefix SID attribute defined as part of section 3 in
   [RFC8669].







Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   The SRv6 SID is carried using Prefix SID attribute as specified in
   [RFC9252], without Transposition Scheme.  The Transposition Length is
   set to 0 and Transposition Offset is set to 0 to indicate nothing is
   transposed and that the entire SRv6 SID value is encoded in the SID
   Information Sub-TLV.

   UDP tunneling information is carried using Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute as specified in [RFC9012].

6.2.  Comparison with Other Families using RFC-8277 Encoding

   SAFI 128 (MPLS-labeled VPN address) is an RFC8277 encoded family that
   carries service prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from
   the customer namespaces and are contextualized into separate user
   virtual service RIBs called VRFs as per [RFC4364].

   SAFI 4 (BGP LU) is an RFC8277 encoded family that carries transport
   prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the provider
   namespace.

   SAFI 76 (Classful Transport SAFI) is an RFC8277 encoded family that
   carries transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from
   the provider namespace and are contextualized into separate TRDB as
   per RFC4364 procedures.

   It is worth noting that SAFI 128 has been used to carry transport
   prefixes in "L3VPN Inter-AS Carrier's carrier" scenario as defined in
   section 10 of [RFC4364], where BGP LU/LDP prefixes in CsC VRF are
   advertised in SAFI 128 towards the remote-end client carrier.

   In this document, SAFI 76 (BGP CT) is used instead of reusing SAFI
   128 (BGP VPN) to carry these transport routes because it is
   operationally advantageous to segregate transport and service
   prefixes into separate address families.  For e.g., such an approach
   allows operators to safely enable "per-prefix" label allocation
   scheme for Classful Transport prefixes, typically with a space
   complexity of O(1K), without affecting SAFI 128 service prefixes,
   with a space complexity of O(1M).  The "per prefix" label allocation
   scheme keeps the routing churn local during topology changes.

   A new SAFI also facilitates having a different readvertisement path
   of the transport family routes in a network than the service route
   readvertisement path.  Service routes (Inet-VPN) are exchanged over
   an EBGP multihop session between ASes with next hop unchanged;
   whereas Classful Transport routes are readvertised over EBGP single
   hop sessions with "next hop self" rewrite over inter-AS links.





Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   The Classful Transport SAFI is similar in vein to BGP LU, in that it
   carries transport prefixes.  The only difference is that it also
   carries in Route Target, an indication of which Transport Class the
   transport prefix belongs to and uses RD to disambiguate multiple
   instances of the same transport prefix in a BGP Update.

6.3.  Usage of Route Distinguisher and Label Allocation Modes

   RDs aid in troubleshooting provider networks that deploy BGP CT, by
   uniquely identifying the originator of a route across an
   administrative domain that may either span multiple domains within a
   provider network or span closely coordinated provider networks.

   The use of RDs also provides an option for signaling forwarding
   diversity within the same Transport Class.  An SN can advertise an
   SEP with the same Transport Class in multiple BGP CT routes with
   unique RDs.

   For e.g., unique "RDx:EP1" prefixes can be advertised by an SN for an
   EP1 to different upstream BNs with unique forwarding specific
   encapsulation (e.g., Label), in order to collect traffic statistics
   at the SN for each BN.  In absence of RD, duplicated Transport Class/
   Color values will be needed in the transport network to achieve such
   use cases.

   The allocation of RDs is done at the point of origin of the BGP CT
   route.  This can either be an Egress SN or a BN.  The default RD
   allocation mode is to use a unique RD per originating node for an EP.
   This mode allows for the ingress to uniquely identify each originated
   path.  Alternatively, the same RD may be provisioned for multiple
   originators of the same EP.  This mode can be used when the ingress
   does not require full visibility of all nodes originating an EP.

   A label is allocated for a BGP CT route when it is advertised with
   next hop self by a SN or a BN.  An implementation may use different
   label allocation modes with BGP CT.  The recommended label allocation
   mode is per-prefix as it provides better traffic convergence
   properties than per-next hop label allocation mode.  Furthermore, BGP
   CT offers two flavors for per-prefix label allocation.  The first
   flavor assigns a label for each unique "RD, EP".  The second flavor
   assigns a label for each unique "Transport Class, EP" while ignoring
   the RD.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   In a BGP CT network, the number of routes at an Ingress PE is a
   function of unique EPs multiplied by BNs in the ingress domain that
   do next hop self.  BGP CT provides flexible RD and Label allocation
   modes to address operational requirements in a multi-domain network.
   The impacts on the control plane and forwarding behavior for the
   above modes are detailed with an example in Managing Transport Route
   Visibility (Section 13.3)

7.  Protocol Procedures

   This section summarizes the procedures followed by various nodes
   speaking Classful Transport family.

7.1.  Preparing the network to deploy Classful Transport planes

      It is responsibility of the operators to decide the Transport
      Classes to enable and use in their network.  They are also
      expected to allocate a Transport Class Route Target to identify
      each Transport Class.

      Operators configure the Transport Classes on the SNs and BNs in
      the network with Transport Class Route Targets and unique Route-
      Distinguishers.

      Implementations MAY provide automatic generation and assignment of
      RD, RT values; they MAY also provide a way to manually override
      the automatic mechanism in order to deal with any conflicts that
      may arise with existing RD, RT values in different network domains
      participating in the deployment.

7.2.  Originating Classful Transport Routes

      BGP CT routes are sent only to BGP peers that have negotiated the
      Multiprotocol Extensions capability described in Section 8 of
      [RFC4760] to be able to send and receive BGP CT routes.

      At the ingress node of the tunnel's home domain, the tunneling
      protocols install tunnel ingress routes in the TRDB associated
      with the Transport Class to which the tunnel belongs.

      The egress node of the tunnel i.e. the tunnel endpoint originates
      the BGP Classful Transport route with NLRI containing
      RD:TunnelEndpoint, Transport Class RT and PNH TunnelEndpoint,
      which will be resolved over the tunnel route in TRDB at the
      ingress node.  When the tunnel is up, the Classful Transport BGP
      route will become usable and get re-advertised by the ingress node
      to BGP peers in neighboring domains.




Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


      Alternatively, the ingress node may advertise this tunnel
      destination into BGP as a Classful Transport family route with
      NLRI RD:TunnelEndpoint, attaching a Transport Class Route Target
      that identifies the Transport Class.  This BGP CT route is
      advertised to EBGP peers and IBGP peers in neighboring domains.
      This route SHOULD NOT be advertised to the IBGP core that contains
      the tunnel, using policy configuration.

      Unique RD SHOULD be used by the originator of a Classful Transport
      route to disambiguate the multiple BGP advertisements for a
      transport endpoint.

7.3.  Processing Classful Transport Routes by Ingress Nodes

      Upon receipt of a BGP Classful Transport route with a PNH that is
      not directly connected (e.g. an IBGP-route), a Mapping Community
      on the route (the Transport Class RT) is used to decide to which
      resolution scheme this route is to be mapped.  The resolution
      scheme for a Transport Class RT with Transport Class ID "C1"
      contains TRDB for Transport Class with same ID.  In cases where
      Transport Class "C1" tunnels are not available in a domain, the
      administrator MAY customize the resolution scheme to map to a
      different set of transport classes available in that domain.

      The routes in the associated TRDBs are used to resolve the
      received PNH.  The order of TRDBs in a resolution scheme is
      followed when resolving the received PNH, such that a route in
      backup TRDB is used only when a matching route was not found in
      the primary TRDBs preceding it.  This achieves the fallback
      desired by the resolution scheme.

      If the resolution process does not find a matching route in any of
      the associated TRDBs, the received BGP CT route MUST be considered
      unusable for forwarding purpose and be withdrawn.

      The received BGP CT route MUST be added to the TRDB corresponding
      to the Transport Class "C1".  So that service routes can resolve
      over this BGP CT ingress route.  RD is stripped by the ingress
      node from the BGP CT NLRI prefix when a BGP CT route is added to a

7.4.  Readvertising Classful Transport Route by Border Nodes with Next
      Hop Self

      BNs allocate an MPLS label to advertise upstream in Classful
      Transport NLRI.  A BN also installs an MPLS route for that label
      that swaps the incoming label with a label received from the
      downstream BGP speaker or pops the incoming label.  It then pushes
      received traffic to the transport tunnel or direct interface that
      the Classful Transport route's PNH resolved over.

      The label SHOULD be allocated with "per-prefix" label allocation
      semantics.  The IP prefix in the TRDB context (Transport-Class,
      IP-prefix) is used as the key to do per-prefix label allocation.
      This helps in avoiding BGP CT route churn throughout the CT
      network when an instability (e.g. link failure) is experienced in
      a domain.  The failure is not propagated further than the BN
      closest to the failure.

      The value of the advertised MPLS label is locally significant, and
      is dynamic by default.  A BN may provide an option to allocate a
      value from a statically carved out range.  This can be achieved
      using locally configured export policy, or via mechanisms such as
      the ones described in BGP Prefix-SID [RFC8669].

7.5.  Border Nodes Receiving Classful Transport Routes on EBGP

      If a route is received with PNH that is known to be directly
      connected (e.g.  EBGP single-hop neighbor address), the directly
      connected interface is checked for MPLS forwarding capability.  No
      other next hop resolution process is performed, as the inter-AS
      link can be used for any Transport Class.

      If the inter-AS links need to honor Transport Class, then the BN
      MUST follow procedures of an Ingress node described above and
      perform next hop resolution process.  The route to directly
      connected PNH SHOULD be installed in the TRDB belonging to the
      associated Transport Class.

7.6.  Avoiding Path Hiding Through Route Reflectors

      When multiple BNs exist such that they advertise a "RD:EP" prefix
      to Route Reflectors (RRs), the RRs may hide all but one of the
      BNs, unless ADDPATH [RFC7911] is used for the Classful Transport
      family.  This is similar to L3VPN Option B scenarios.  Hence,
      ADDPATH SHOULD be used for Classful Transport family, to avoid
      path-hiding through RRs.

7.7.  Avoiding Loops Between Route Reflectors in Forwarding Path

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


      A pair of redundant ABRs, each acting as an RR with next hop self,
      may choose each other as best path instead of the upstream ASBR,
      causing a traffic forwarding loop.  This happens because of
      following the path selection rule specified in Section 9 of BGP RR
      [RFC4456] that tie-breaks on ORIGINATOR_ID before CLUSTER_LIST.
      RFC4456 considers pure RR which is not in forwarding path.  When a
      RR is in forwarding path and reflects routes with next hop self,
      as is the case for ABR BNs in a BGP transport network, this rule
      may cause loops.

      Implementations SHOULD provide a way to alter the tie-breaking
      rule specified in Section 9 of BGP RR [RFC4456] so as to tie-break
      on CLUSTER_LIST step before ORIGINATOR_ID step, when performing
      path selection for BGP CT routes.

      This document suggests the following modification to the BGP
      Decision Process Tie Breaking rules (Section. 9.1.2.2 of
      [RFC4271]) that can be applied to path selection of BGP CT family
      routes:

      The following rule SHOULD be inserted between Steps e) and f): a
      BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter CLUSTER_LIST
      length.  The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route does not carry
      the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.

      Taking into account some other deployment considerations can also
      help in avoiding this problem, e.g.,:

      -  IGP metric should be assigned such that "ABR to redundant ABR"
         cost is inferior than "ABR to upstream ASBR" cost.

      -  Tunnels belonging to non-best effort Transport Classes SHOULD
         NOT be provisioned between ABRs.  This will ensure that the
         route received from an ABR with next hop self will not be
         usable at a redundant ABR.

      This softens the possibility of such loops altogether.

7.8.  Ingress Nodes Receiving Service Routes with a Mapping Community

      Upon receipt of a BGP service route with a PNH that is not
      directly connected (e.g. an IBGP-route), a Mapping Community on
      the route (e.g, Color Extended Community) is used to decide to
      which resolution scheme this route is to be mapped.  The
      resolution scheme for a Color Extended Community with Color "C1"
      contains TRDB for Transport Class with same ID, followed by Best-
      Effort TRDB.  The administrator MAY customize the resolution
      scheme to map to a different ordered list of TRDBs.



Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


      The routes in the associated TRDBs are used to resolve the
      received PNH.  The order of TRDBs in a resolution scheme is
      followed when resolving the received PNH, such that a route in
      backup TRDB is used only when a matching route was not found in
      the primary TRDBs preceding it.  This achieves the fallback
      desired by the resolution scheme.

      If the resolution process does not find a Tunnel Ingress Route in
      any of the Transport Route Databases, the service route MUST be
      considered unusable for forwarding purpose and be withdrawn.

7.9.  Coordination Between Domains Using Different Community Namespaces

      Cooperating Inter-AS Option-C domains may sometimes not agree on
      RT, RD, Mapping community or Transport Route Target values because
      of differences in community namespaces (e.g. during network
      mergers or renumbering for expansion).  Such deployments may
      deploy mechanisms to map and rewrite the Route Target values on
      domain boundaries, using per ASBR import policies.  This is no
      different than any other BGP VPN family.  Mechanisms used in
      inter-AS VPN deployments may be leveraged with the Classful
      Transport family also.

      The resolution schemes SHOULD allow association with multiple
      Mapping Communities.  This helps with renumbering, network mergers
      or transitions.

      The Transport Class Route Target Extended Community is useful to
      avoid collision with regular Route Target namespace used by
      service routes.

7.10.  Best Effort Transport Class

      It is possible to represent 'Best effort' SLA also as a Transport
      Class.  Today, BGP LU (SAFI 4) is used to extend the best effort
      intra domain tunnels to other domains.

      Alternatively, BGP CT (SAFI 76) may be used to carry the best
      effort tunnels also.  This document reserves the Transport Class
      ID value 0 to represent "Best Effort Transport Class ID".
      However, implementations SHOULD provide configuration to use a
      different value for this purpose.

      The 'Best Effort Transport Class ID' value is used in the
      'Transport Class ID' field of Transport Route Target Extended
      Community that is attached to the BGP CT route that advertises a
      best effort tunnel endpoint.  The RT thus formed is called the
      "Best Effort Transport Class Route Target".

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


      When a BN or SN receives a BGP CT route with Best Effort Transport
      Class Route Target as the mapping community, the Best effort
      resolution scheme is used for resolving the BGP next hop, and the
      resultant route is installed in the best effort transport route
      database.  If no best effort tunnel was found to resolve the BGP
      next hop, the BGP CT route MUST be considered unusable, and not be
      propagated further.

      When a BGP speaker receives an overlay route without any explicit
      Mapping Community, and absent local policy, the best effort
      resolution scheme is used for resolving the BGP next hop on the
      route.  This behavior is backward compatible to behavior of an
      implementation that does not follow procedures described in this
      document.

      Implementations MAY provide configuration to selectively install
      BGP CT routes to the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), to provide
      reachability for control plane peering towards endpoints in other
      domains.

7.11.  Interaction with BGP Attributes Specifying Next Hop Address and
       Color

   The Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute, described in [RFC9012] can be
   used to request a specific type of tunnel encapsulation.  This
   attribute may apply to BGP service routes or transport routes,
   including BGP Classful Transport family routes.

   The mechanisms described in BGP MultiNexthop Attribute
   [MULTI-NH-ATTR] allow a BGP route to carry multiple next hop
   addresses.  It also allows specifying 'Transport Class ID' as a
   qualifier for each next hop address.

   It should be noted that in such cases "Transport Class/Color" can
   exist in multiple places on the same route, and a precedence order
   needs to be established to determine which Transport Class the
   route's next hop should resolve over.  This document suggests the
   following order of precedence, more preferred first:

      Transport Class ID SubTLV, in MultiNexthop Attribute.

      Color SubTLV, in Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute.

      Transport Target Extended community, on BGP CT route.

      Color Extended community, on BGP service route.





Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   The above precedence order follows more specific scoping of Color to
   less specific scoping.

   Transport Class ID specified for Nexthop-Leg subTLV in a MultiNextHop
   attribute is more specific indication of Color than Color subTLV in a
   TEA, which in turn is more specific than Mapping Community (Transport
   Target) on a BGP CT transport route, which is in turn more specific
   than a Service route scoped Mapping Community (Color Extended
   community).

7.12.  Applicability to Flowspec Redirect to IP

   Flowspec routes using Redirect to IP next hop is described in
   [FLOWSPEC-REDIR-IP]

   Such Flowspec BGP routes with Redirect to IP next hop MAY be attached
   with a Mapping Community (e.g.  Color:0:100), which allows
   redirecting the flow traffic over a tunnel to the IP next hop
   satisfying the desired SLA (e.g.  Transport Class color 100).

   Flowspec BGP family acts as just another service that can make use of
   BGP CT architecture to achieve Flow based forwarding with SLAs.

8.  Scaling Considerations

8.1.  Avoiding Unintended Spread of BGP CT Routes Across Domains

      [RFC8212] suggests BGP speakers require explicit configuration of
      both BGP Import and Export Policies in order to receive or send
      routes over EBGP sessions.

      It is recommended to follow this for BGP CT routes.  It will
      prohibit unintended advertisement of transport routes throughout
      the BGP CT transport domain, which may span across multiple AS
      domains.  This will conserve usage of MPLS label and next hop
      resources in the network.  An ASBR of a domain can be provisioned
      to allow routes with only the Transport Route Targets that are
      required by SNs in the domain.

8.2.  Constrained Distribution of PNHs to SNs (On-Demand Next Hop)

      This section describes how the number of Protocol Next hops
      advertised to a SN or BN can be constrained using BGP Classful
      Transport and Route Target Constraints (RTC) [RFC4684].







Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


      An egress SN MAY advertise BGP CT route for RD:eSN with two Route
      Targets: transport-target:0:<TC> and a RT carrying <eSN>:<TC>.
      Where TC is the Transport Class identifier, and eSN is the IP-
      address used by SN as BGP next hop in its service route
      advertisements.

      Note that such use of the IP address specific route target
      <eSN>:<TC> is optional in a BGP CT network.  It is required only
      if there is a requirement to prune the propagation of the
      transport route for an egress node eSN to only the set of ingress
      nodes that need it.  When only RT of transport-target:0:<TC> is
      used, the pruning happens in granularity of Transport Class ID
      (Color), and not BGP next hop; BGP CT routes will not be
      advertised into domains with PEs that don't import its transport
      class.

      The transport-target:0:<TC> is the new type of route target
      (Transport Class RT) defined in this document.  It is carried in
      BGP extended community attribute (BGP attribute code 16).

      The RT carrying <eSN>:<TC> MAY be an IP-address specific regular
      RT (BGP attribute code 16), IPv6-address specific RT (BGP
      attribute code 25), or a Wide-communities based RT (BGP attribute
      code 34) as described in Route Target Constrain Extension
      [RTC-Ext].  This document recommends using Wide-communities based
      RT for the same.

      An ingress SN MAY import BGP CT routes with Route Target carrying
      <eSN>:<TC>.  The ingress SN may learn the eSN values either by
      configuration, or it may discover them from the BGP next hop field
      in the BGP VPN service routes received from eSN.  A BGP ingress SN
      receiving a BGP service route with next hop of eSN SHOULD generate
      a RTC/Extended-RTC route for Route Target prefix <Origin
      ASN>:<eSN>/[80|176] in order to learn BGP CT transport routes to
      reach eSN.  This allows constrained distribution of the transport
      routes to the PNHs actually required by iSN.

      When the path of route propagation of BGP CT routes is same as the
      RTC routes, a BN would learn the RTC routes advertised by ingress
      SNs and propagate further.  This will allow constraining
      distribution of BGP CT routes for a PNH to only the necessary BNs
      in the network, closer to the egress SN.

      This mechanism provides "On Demand Next hop" of BGP CT routes,
      which help with the scaling of MPLS forwarding state at SN and BN.






Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


      However, the amount of state carried in RTC family may become
      proportional to the number of PNHs in the network.  To strike a
      balance, the RTC route advertisements for <Origin
      ASN>:<eSN>/[80|176] MAY be confined to the BNs in home region of
      ingress-SN, or the BNs of a super core.

      Such a BN in the core of the network SHOULD import BGP CT routes
      with Transport-Target:0:<TC> and generate a RTC route for <Origin
      ASN>:0:<TC>/96, while not propagating the more specific RTC
      requests for specific PNHs.  This will let the BN learn transport
      routes to all eSN nodes but confine their propagation to ingress-
      SNs.

8.3.  Limiting The Visibility Scope of PE Loopback as PNHs

      It may be even more desirable to limit the number of PNHs that are
      globally visible in the network.  This is possible using mechanism
      described in Appendix D

      Such that advertisement of PE loopback addresses as next-hop in
      BGP service routes is confined to the region they belong to.  An
      anycast IP-address called "Context Protocol Nexthop Address"
      (CPNH, Appendix D.3) abstracts the SNs in a region from other
      regions in the network, swapping the SN scoped service label with
      a CPNH scoped private namespace label.

      This provides much greater advantage in terms of scaling and
      convergence.  Changes to implement this feature are required only
      on the local region's BNs and RRs.

9.  OAM Considerations

   MPLS OAM procedures specified in [RFC8029] also apply to BGP Classful
   Transport.

   The 'Target FEC Stack' sub-TLV for IPv4 Classful Transport has a Sub-
   Type of 31744, and a length of 13.  The Value field consists of the
   RD advertised with the Classful Transport prefix, the IPv4 prefix
   (with trailing 0 bits to make 32 bits in all) and a prefix length
   encoded as shown in Figure 3:

   These prefix layouts are inherited from Sections 3.2.5, 3.2.6 in
   [RFC8029]

10.  Applicability to Network Slicing

   In Network Slicing, the Transport Slice Controller (TSC) is
   responsible for customizing and setting up the underlying transport
   (e.g.  RSVP-TE, SRTE tunnels with desired characteristics) and
   resources (e.g., polices/shapers) in a transport network to create an
   IETF Network Slice.

   The Transport Class construct described in this document can be used
   to realize the "IETF Network Slice" defined in [TEAS-NS]



Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   The TSC can use the Transport Class Identifier (Color value) to
   provision a transport tunnel in a specific IETF Network Slice.

   Further, the Network Slice Controller can use the Mapping Community
   on the service route to map traffic to the desired IETF Network
   Slice.

11.  SRv6 Support

   This section describes how BGP CT family (SAFI 76) may be used to set
   up inter domain tunnels of a certain Transport Class, when using
   Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) data plane on the inter AS links or
   as an intra AS tunneling mechanism.

   [RFC8986] specifies the SRv6 Endpoint behaviors (End USD, End.BM,
   End.B6.Encaps).  [SRV6-INTER-DOMAIN] specifies the SRv6 Endpoint
   behaviors (END.REPLACE, END.REPLACEB6 and END.DB6).  These are
   leveraged for BGP CT routes with SRv6 data plane.

   The BGP Classful Transport route update for SRv6 MUST include an
   attribute containing SRv6 SID information.  This may be either the
   BGP Prefix-SID attribute as specified in [RFC9252] or the BGP
   MultiNexthop attribute as specified in BGP MultiNexthop Attribute
   [MULTI-NH-ATTR] section 5.4.3.3.  If the Prefix-SID attribute is
   used, it MUST NOT include SRv6 SID structure for Transposition
   described in [RFC9252].

   It should be noted that prefixes carried in BGP CT family are
   transport layer end-points, e.g.  PE loopback addresses.  Thus, the
   SRv6 SID carried in a BGP CT route is also a transport layer
   identifier.  For an illustration of BGP CT deployment in SRv6
   neworks, refer to Appendix E .

            Figure 5: Reference Topology: Multi domain BGP CT Network

   This example shows a provider network that consists of two ASes, AS1
   and AS2.  They are serving customers AS3, AS4 respectively.  Traffic
   direction being described is CE41 to CE31.  CE31 may request a
   specific SLA (e.g. mapped to Gold for this example), when traversing
   these provider networks.

   AS2 is further divided into two regions.  So, there are three tunnel
   domains in provider's space.  AS1 uses ISIS Flex-Algo [RFC9350]
   intra-domain tunnels, whereas AS2 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels.

   The network exposes two Transport Classes: "Gold" with Transport
   Class id 100, "Bronze" with Transport Class id 200.  These Transport
   Classes are provisioned at the PEs and the Border nodes (ABRs, ASBRs)
   in the network.

   Following tunnels exist for Gold Transport Class.

      PE25_to_ABR23_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE25_to_ABR24_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR13_to_PE11_gold - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR14_to_PE11_gold - SRTE tunnel

   Following tunnels exist for Bronze Transport Class.

      PE25_to_ABR23_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR23_to_ASBR21_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR23_to_ASBR22_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR24_to_ASBR21_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR13_to_PE12_bronze - ISIS FlexAlgo tunnel

      ASBR14_to_PE11_bronze - ISIS FlexAlgo tunnel

   These tunnels are either provisioned or auto-discovered to belong to
   Transport Classes 100 or 200.

12.2.  Service Layer Route Exchange

   Service nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate service families (SAFIs 1, 128) on
   the BGP session with RR16.  Service helpers RR16 and RR26 exchange
   these service routes with next hop unchanged over a multihop EBGP
   session between the two AS.  PE25 negotiates service families (AFI: 1
   and SAFIs 1, 128) with RR26.

   The PEs see each other as next hop in the BGP Update for the service
   family routes.  Addpath send, receive is enabled on both directions
   on the EBGP multihop session between RR16 and RR26 for SAFIs 1, 128.
   Addpath send is negotiated in the RR to PE direction in each AS.
   This is to avoid path hiding of service routes at RR.  E.g.  SAFI 1
   routes advertised by both PE11 and PE12.  Or, SAFI 128 routes
   originated by both PE11 and PE12 using same RD.

   Forwarding happens using service routes installed at service nodes
   PE25, PE11, PE12 only.  Service routes received from CEs are not
   present in any other nodes' FIB in the network.

   As an example, CE31 advertises a route for prefix 31.31.31.31 with
   next hop as self to PE11, PE12.  CE31 can attach a Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 on this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA.  Or,
   PE11 can attach the same using locally configured policies.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   Consider, CE31 is getting VPN service from PE11.  The RD1:31.31.31.31
   route is readvertised in SAFI 128 by PE11 with next hop self
   (1.1.1.1) and label V-L1, to RR16 with the Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 attached.  RR16 advertises this route with Addpath-ID to
   RR26 which readvertises to PE25 with next hop unchanged.  Now, PE25
   can resolve the PNH 1.1.1.1 using transport routes received in BGP CT
   or BGP LU.

   Using Addpath, service routes advertised by PE11 and PE12 for SAFIs
   1, 128 reach PE25 via RR16, RR26 with the next hop unchanged, as PE11
   or PE12.

   The IP FIB at PE25 VRF will have a route for 31.31.31.31 with a next
   hop when resolved, that points to a Gold tunnel in ingress domain.

12.3.  Transport Layer Route Propagation

   Egress nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate BGP CT family with transport ASBRs
   ASBR13, ASBR14.  These egress nodes originate BGP CT routes for
   tunnel endpoint addresses, that are advertised as next hop in BGP
   service routes.  In this example, both PEs participate in transport
   classes Gold and Bronze.  The protocol procedures are explained using
   Gold SLA transport plane and the Bronze SLA transport plane is used
   to highlight the path hiding aspects.

   PE11 is provisioned with transport class 100, RD value 1.1.1.1:10 and
   a transport-target:0:100 for Gold tunnels.  And a Transport class 200
   with RD value 1.1.1.1:20, and transport route target 0:200 for Bronze
   tunnels.  Similarly, PE12 is provisioned with transport class 100, RD
   value 1.1.1.2:10 and a transport-target:0:100 for Gold tunnels.  And
   transport class 200, RD value 1.1.1.2:20 with transport-target:0:200
   for Bronze tunnels.  Note that in this example, the BGP CT routes
   carry only the transport class route target, and no IP address format
   route target.

   The RD value originated by an egress node is not modified by any BGP
   speakers when the route is readvertised to the ingress node.  Thus,
   the RD can be used to identify the originator (unique RD provisioned)
   or set of originators (RD reused on multiple nodes).

   Similarly, these transport classes are also configured on ASBRs, ABRs
   and PEs with same Transport Route Target and unique RDs.

   ASBR13 and ASBR14 negotiate BGP CT family with transport ASBRs
   ASBR21, ASBR22 in neighboring AS.  They negotiate BGP CT family with
   RR27 in region 2, which reflects BGP CT routes to ABR23, ABR24.
   ABR23, ABR24 negotiate BGP CT family with Ingress node PE25 in region
   1.  BGP LU family is also negotiated on these sessions alongside BGP
   CT family.  BGP LU carries "best effort" transport class routes, BGP
   CT carries gold, bronze transport class routes.

   PE11 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with Gold SLA to
   endpoint PE11.  This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix
   1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1, Label B-L0, next hop 1.1.1.1 and a route target
   extended community transport-target:0:100.  Label B-L0 can either be
   Implicit Null (Label 3) or an Ultimate Hop Pop (UHP) label.

   This route is received by ASBR13 and it resolves over the tunnel
   ASBR13_to_PE11_gold.  The route is then readvertised by ASBR13 in BGP
   CT family to ASBRs ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy.  This
   route is sent with same NLRI RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1, Label
   B-L1, next hop self, and transport-target:0:100.  MPLS swap route is
   installed at ASBR13 for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to
   ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel.

   Similarly, ASBR14 also receives BGP CT route for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1
   from PE11 and it resolves over the tunnel ASBR14_to_PE11_gold.  The
   route is then readvertised by ASBR14 in BGP CT family to ASBRs
   ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy.  This route is sent with
   same NLRI RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1, Label B-L2, next hop self,
   and transport-target:0:100.  MPLS swap route is installed at ASBR14
   for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to ASBR14_to_PE11_gold tunnel.

   In the Bronze plane, BGP CT route with Bronze SLA to endpoint PE11 is
   originated by PE11 with a NLRI containing RD prefix
   1.1.1.1:20:1.1.1.1, and appropriate label.  The RD allows both Gold
   and Bronze advertisements traverse path selection pinchpoints without
   any path hiding at RRs or ASBRs.  And route target extended community
   transport-target:0:200 lets the route resolve over Bronze tunnels in
   the network, similar to the process being described for Gold SLA
   path.

   Moving back to the Gold plane, ASBR21 receives the Gold SLA BGP CT
   routes for NLRI RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 over the single hop EBGP
   sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and can compute ECMP/FRR towards them.
   ASBR21 readvertises BGP CT route for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with next hop
   self (loopback address 2.2.2.1) to RR27, advertising a new label
   B-L3.  MPLS swap route is installed for label B-L3 at ASBR21 to swap
   to received label B-L1, B-L2 and forward to ASBR13, ASBR14
   respectively.  RR27 readvertises this BGP CT route to ABR23, ABR24
   with label and next hop unchanged.



Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   Similarly, ASBR22 receives BGP CT route 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 over the
   single hop EBGP sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and readvertises with
   next hop self (loopback address 2.2.2.2) to RR27, advertising a new
   label B-L4.  MPLS swap route is installed for label B-L4 at ASBR22 to
   swap to received label B-L1, B-L2 and forward to ASBR13, ASBR14
   respectively.  RR27 readvertises this BGP CT route also to ABR23,
   ABR24 with label and next hop unchanged.

   Addpath is enabled for BGP CT family on the sessions between RR27 and
   ASBRs, ABRs such that routes for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with the next
   hops ASBR21 and ASBR22 are reflected to ABR23, ABR24 without any path
   hiding.  Thus giving ABR23 visibility of both available next hops for
   Gold SLA.

   ABR23 receives the route with next hop 2.2.2.1, label B-L3 from RR27.
   The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route acts as
   Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the next
   hop using transport class 100 routes only.  ABR23 is unable to find a
   route for 2.2.2.1 with transport class 100.  Thus, it considers this
   route unusable and does not propagate it further.  This prunes ASBR21
   from Gold SLA tunneled path.

   ABR23 also receives the route with next hop 2.2.2.2, label B-L4 from
   RR27.  The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route acts
   as Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the
   next hop using transport class 100 routes only.  ABR23 successfully
   resolves the next hop to point to ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.  ABR23
   readvertises this BGP CT route with next hop self (loopback address
   2.2.2.3) and a new label B-L5 to PE25.  Swap route for B-L5 is
   installed by ABR23 to swap to label B-L4, and forward into
   ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.

   PE25 receives the BGP CT route for prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with
   label B-L5, next hop 2.2.2.3 and transport-target:0:100 from RR26.
   And it similarly resolves the next hop 2.2.2.3 over transport class
   100, pushing labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.

   In this manner, the Gold transport LSP "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" in
   egress-domain is extended by BGP CT until the ingress-node PE25 in
   ingress domain, to create an end-to-end Gold SLA path.  MPLS swap
   routes are installed at ASBR13, ASBR22 and ABR23, when propagating
   the PE11 BGP CT Gold transport class route 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with
   next hop self towards PE25.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   The BGP CT LSP thus formed, originates in PE25, and terminates in
   ASBR13 (assuming PE11 advertised Implicit Null), traversing over the
   Gold underlay LSPs in each domain.  ASBR13 uses UHP to stitch the BGP
   CT LSP into the "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" LSP to traverse the last
   domain, thus satisfying Gold SLA end-to-end.

   When PE25 receives service routes from RR26 with next hop 1.1.1.1 and
   mapping community Color:0:100, it resolves over this BGP CT route
   1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1.  Thus pushing label B-L5, and pushing as top
   label the labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.

12.4.  Data Plane View

12.4.1.  Steady State

   This section describes how the data plane looks like in steady state.

   CE41 transmits an IP packet with destination as 31.31.31.31.  On
   receiving this packet, PE25 performs a lookup in the IP FIB
   associated with the CE41 interface.  This lookup yields the service
   route that pushes the VPN service label V-L1, BGP CT label B-L5, and
   labels for PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.  Thus, PE25 encapsulates the IP
   packet in MPLS packet with label V-L1(innermost), B-L5, and top label
   as PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.  This MPLS packet is thus transmitted
   to ABR23 using Gold SLA.

   ABR23 decapsulates the packet received on PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel
   as required, and finds the MPLS packet with label B-L5.  It performs
   lookup for label B-L5 in the global MPLS FIB.  This yields the route
   that swaps label B-L5 with label B-L4, and pushes the top label
   provided by ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.  Thus, ABR23 transmits the
   MPLS packet with label B-L4 to ASBR22, on a tunnel that satisfies
   Gold SLA.

   ASBR22 similarly performs a lookup for label B-L4 in global MPLS FIB,
   finds the route that swaps label B-L4 with label B-L2, and forwards
   to ASBR13 over the directly connected MPLS enabled interface.  This
   interface is a common resource not dedicated to any specific
   transport class, in this example.

   ASBR13 receives the MPLS packet with label B-L2, and performs a
   lookup in MPLS FIB, finds the route that pops label B-L2, and pushes
   labels associated with ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel.  This transmits
   the MPLS packet with VPN label V-L1 to PE11 using a tunnel that
   preserves Gold SLA in AS 1.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   PE11 receives the MPLS packet with V-L1, and performs VPN forwarding.
   Thus transmitting the original IP payload from CE41 to CE31.  The
   payload has traversed path satisfying Gold SLA end-to-end.

12.4.2.  Local Repair of Primary Path

   This section describes how the data plane at ASBR22 reacts when the
   link between ASBR22 and ASBR13 experiences a failure, and an
   alternate path exists.

   Assuming ASBR22_to_ASBR13 link goes down, such that traffic with Gold
   SLA going to PE11 needs repair.  ASBR22 has an alternate BGP CT route
   for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 from ASBR14.  This has been preprogrammed in
   forwarding by ASBR22 as FRR backup next hop for label B-L4.  This
   allows the Gold SLA traffic to be locally repaired at ASBR22 without
   the failure event propagated in the BGP CT network.  In this case,
   ingress node PE25 will not know there was a failure, and traffic
   restoration will be independent of prefix scale (PIC).

12.4.3.  Absorbing Failure of Primary Path: Fallback to Best Effort
         Tunnels

   This section describes how the data plane reacts when gold path
   experiences a failure, but no alternate path exists.

   Assuming tunnel ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold goes down, such that now end-to-
   end Gold path does not exist in the network.  This makes the BGP CT
   route for RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 unusable at ABR23.  This makes
   ABR23 send a BGP withdrawal for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 to PE25.

   Withdrawal for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 allows PE25 to react to the loss of
   gold path to 1.1.1.1.  Assuming PE25 is provisioned to use best-
   effort transport class as the backup path, this withdrawal of BGP CT
   route allows PE25 to adjust the next hop of the VPN Service-route to
   push the labels provided by the BGP LU route.  That repairs the
   traffic to go via best effort path.  PE25 can also be provisioned to
   use Bronze transport class as the backup path.  The repair will
   happen in similar manner in that case as-well.

   Traffic repair to absorb the failure happens at ingress node PE25, in
   a service prefix scale independent manner.  This is called PIC
   (Prefix scale Independent Convergence).  The repair time will be
   proportional to time taken for withdrawing the BGP CT route.

   The above examples demonstrate the various levels of failsafe
   mechanisms available to protect traffic in a BGP CT network.

13.  Deployment Considerations.

13.1.  Managing Intent at Service and Transport layers.

   Illustration of BGP CT Procedures (Section 12) shows multiple domains
   that agree on a color name space (Agreeing Color Domains) and contain
   tunnels with equivalent set of colors (Homogenous Color Domains).

   However in the real world, this may not always be guaranteed.  Two
   domains may independently manage their color namespaces, these are
   known as Non-Agreeing Color Domains.  Two domains may have tunnels
   with unequal set of colors, these are known as Heterogeneous Color
   Domains.

   This section describes how BGP CT is deployed in such scenarios to
   preserve end to end Intent.  Example described in this section use
   Inter AS option C domains.  But similar mechanisms will work for
   Inter AS Option A and Inter AS Option B scenarios as-well.

13.1.1.  Service Layer Color Management

   At the service layer, it is recommended that a global color namespace
   be maintained across multiple co-operating domains.  BGP CT allows
   indirection using resolution schemes to be able to maintain a global
   namespace in the service layer.  This is possible even if each domain
   independently maintains its own local transport color namespace.

   As explained in next hop Resolution Scheme (Section 5) , mapping
   community carried on service route maps to a resolution scheme.  The
   mapping community values for the service route can be abstract and
   does not require to match the transport color namespace.  This
   abstract mapping community value representing a global service layer
   intent is mapped to a local transport layer intent available in each
   domain.

   In this manner, it is recommended to keep color namespace management
   at the service layer and the transport layer decoupled from each
   other.  In the following sections the service layer agrees on a
   single global namespace.

13.1.2.  Non-Agreeing Color Transport Domains

   Non-agreeing color domains require a mapping community rewrite on
   each domain boundary.  This rewrite helps to map one domain's
   namespace to another.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   The below example illustrates how traffic is stitched and SLA is
   preserved when domains don't use the same namespace at the transport
   layer.  Each domain specifies the same SLA using different color
   values.

            Gold(100)              Gold(300)               Gold(500)


       [PE11]----[ASBR11]---[ASBR21------[ASBR22]---[ASBR31-------[PE31]
              AS1                     AS2                    AS3


            Bronze(200)          Bronze(400)             Bronze(600)

              ----------- Packet Forwarding Direction -------->

        Figure 6: Transport Layer with Non-agreeing Color Domains

   In the topology in Figure 6, we have three Autonomous Systems.  All
   the nodes in the topology supports BGP CT.

   In AS1 Gold SLA is represented by color 100 and Bronze by 200.

   In AS2 Gold SLA is represented by color 300 and Bronze by 400.

   In AS3 Gold SLA is represented by color 500 and Bronze by 600.

   Though the color values are different, they map to tunnels with
   sufficiently similar TE characteristics in each domain.

   The service route carries an abstract mapping community that maps to
   the required SLA.  For example, Service routes that need to resolve
   over gold transport tunnels, carries a mapping community
   color:0:100500.  In AS3 it maps to a resolution scheme containing
   TRDB with color 500 whereas in AS2 it maps to a TRDB with color 300
   and in AS1 it maps to a TRDB with color 100.  Co-ordination is needed
   to provision the resolution schemes in each domain as explained
   above.

   At the AS boundary, the transport-class route-target is rewritten for
   the BGP CT routes.  In the above topology, At ASBR31 the transport-
   target:0:500 for gold tunnels is rewritten to transport-target:0:300
   and then advertised to ASBR22.  Similarly, the transport-target:0:300
   for gold tunnels are re-written to transport-target:0:100 at ASBR21
   before advertising to ASBR11.  At PE11, the transport route received
   with transport-target:0:100 will be added to the color 100 TRDB.  The
   service route received with mapping community color:0:100500 at PE1
   maps to the gold TRDB and resolves over this transport route.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   Inter-domain traffic forwarding in the above topology works as
   explained in Section 12.

   Transport-target re-write requires co-ordination of color values
   between domains in the transport layer.  This method avoids the need
   to re-write service route mapping community, keeping the service
   layer homogenous and simple to manage.  Coordinating Transport Class
   RT between adjacent domains is easier than coordinating service layer
   colors deployed in various non-adjacent domains.

13.1.3.  Heterogeneous Agreeing Color Transport Domains

   In a heterogeneous domains scenario, it might not be possible to map
   a service layer intent to the matching transport color, as the color
   might not be locally available in a domain.

   The below example illustrates how traffic is stitched, when a transit
   AS contains more shades for an SLA paths compared to Ingress and
   Egress domains.  This example shows how service routes can traverse
   through finer shades when available and take coarse shades otherwise.

        Figure 7: Tranport Layer with Heterogenous Color Domains

   In the topology in Figure 7, we have three Autonomous Systems.  All
   the nodes in the topology support BGP CT.

   In AS1 Gold SLA is represented by color 100.

   In AS2 Gold has finer shades: Gold1 by color 101 and Gold2 by color
   102.

   In AS3 Gold SLA is represented by color 100.

   This problem can be solved by two approaches, described below.

13.1.3.1.  Duplicate Tunnels Approach

   In this approach, duplicate tunnels that satisfy Gold SLA are
   configured in domains AS1 and AS3, but they are given fine grained
   colors 101, 102.

   These tunnels will be installed in TRDBs corresponding to transport
   classes of color 101, 102.

   Service routes received with mapping community (eg: transport-target
   or color community) can resolve over these tunnels in the TRDB with
   matching color by using resolution schemes.

   This approach consumes more resources in the transport and forwarding
   layer, because of the duplicate tunnels.

13.1.3.2.  Customized Resolution Schemes Approach

   In this approach, resolution schemes in domains AS1 and AS3 are
   customized to map the received mapping community (e.g., transport-
   target or color community) over available Gold SLA tunnels.  This
   conserves resource usage with no additional state in transport and
   forwarding plane.

   Service routes advertised by PE31 that need to resolve over Gold1
   transport tunnels carry a mapping community color:0:101.  In AS3 and
   AS1, where Gold1 is not available, it is mapped to color 100 TRDB
   using a customized resolution scheme.  In AS2, Gold1 is available and
   it maps to color 101 TRDB.

   To facilitate this mapping, every SN/BN in all AS provision required
   transport classes viz. 100, 101 and 102.  SN and BN in AS1 and AS3
   are provisioned with customized resolution schemes that resolve
   routes with transport-target:0:101 or transport-target:0:102 strictly
   over color 100 TRDB.

   PE31 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with color 101 for
   endpoint PE31.  This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix RD1:PE31 and
   route target extended community transport-target:0:101.

   At ASBR31, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP CT
   route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB.  ASBR31 is
   provisioned with customized resolution scheme that resolves the
   routes carrying mapping community transport-target:0:101 to resolve
   using color 100 TRDB.  This route is then re-advertised from color
   101 TRDB to ASBR22 with route-target:0:101.

   At ASBR22, the BGP CT routes received with transport-target:0:101
   will be added to color 101 TRDB and strictly resolve over tunnel
   routes in the same TRDB.  This route is re-advertised to ASBR21 with
   transport-target:0:101.

   Similarly, at ASBR21, the BGP CT routes received with transport-
   target:0:101 will be added to color 101 TRDB and strictly resolve
   over tunnel routes in the same TRDB.  This route is re-advertised to
   ASBR11 with transport-target:0:101.

   At ASBR11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP CT
   route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB.  ASBR11 is
   provisioned with a customized resolution scheme that resolves the
   routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.  This
   route is then re-advertised from color 101 TRDB to PE11 with route-
   target:0:101.

   At PE11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP CT
   route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB.  PE11 is
   provisioned with a customized resolution scheme that resolves the
   routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.

   When PE11 receives the service route with the mapping community
   color:0:101 it directly resolves over the BGP CT route in color 101
   TRDB, which in turn resolves over tunnel routes in color 100 TRDB.

   In doing so, PE11 can forward traffic via tunnels with color 101,
   color 102 in the core domain, and color 100 in the metro domains.

13.2.  Migration Scenarios.

13.2.1.  BGP CT Islands Connected via BGP LU Domain

   This section explains how end-to-end SLA can be achieved while
   transiting a domain that does not support BGP CT (SAFI 76).  BGP LU
   (SAFI 4) is used in such domains to connect the BGP CT islands.

   In the above topology, there are three AS domains.  AS1 and AS3
   supports BGP CT, while AS2 does not support BGP CT.

   Nodes in AS1, AS2, and AS3 negotiate BGP LU family on IBGP sessions
   within the domain.  Nodes in AS1 and AS3 negotiate BGP CT family on
   IBGP sessions within the domain.  ASBR11 and ASBR21 as well as ASBR22
   and ASBR31 negotiate BGP LU family on the EBGP session over directly
   connected interdomain links.  ASBR11 and ASBR31 have reachability to
   each other's loopbacks through BGP LU.  ASBR11 and ASBR31 negotiate
   BGP CT family over a multihop EBGP session formed using BGP LU
   reachability.

   The following tunnels exist for Gold Transport Class

      PE11_to_ASBR11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR11_to_PE11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE31_to_ASBR31_gold - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR31_to_PE31_gold - SRTE tunnel

   Following tunnels exist for Bronze Transport Class

      PE11_to_ASBR11_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR11_to_PE11_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE31_to_ASBR31_bronze - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR31_to_PE31_bronze - SRTE tunnel

   These tunnels are provisioned to belong to Transport Classes gold and
   bronze, and are advertised between ASBR31 and ASBR11 with Next hop
   self.

   In AS2, that does not support BGP CT, a separate loopback may be used
   on ASBR22 and ASBR21 to represent gold and bronze SLAs viz
   ASBR22_lpbk_gold, ASBR22_lpbk_bronze, ASBR21_lpbk_gold and
   ASBR21_lpbk_bronze.

   Further, the following tunnels exist in AS2 to satisfy the different
   SLAs, using per SLA loopback endpoints:

      ASBR21_to_ASBR22_lpbk_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR21_to_ASBR22_lpbk_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

   RD:PE11 BGP CT route is originated from PE11 towards ASBR11 with
   transport-target gold.  ASBR11 readvertises this route with next hop
   set to ASBR11_lpbk_gold on the EBGP multihop session towards ASBR31.
   ASBR11 originates BGP LU route for endpoint ASBR11_lpbk_gold on EBGP
   session to ASBR21 with a 'gold SLA' community, and BGP LU route for
   ASBR11_lpbk_bronze with a 'bronze SLA' community.  The SLA community
   is used by ASBR31 to publish the BGP LU routes in the corresponding
   BGP CT TRDBs.

   ASBR21 readvertises the BGP LU route for endpoint ASBR11_lpbk_gold to
   ASBR22 with next hop set by local policy config to the unique
   loopback ASBR21_lpbk_gold by matching the 'gold SLA' community
   received as part BGP LU advertisement from ASBR11.  ASBR22 receives
   this route and resolves the next hop over the
   ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_gold RSVP-TE tunnel.  On successful resolution,
   ASBR22 readvertises this BGP LU route to ASBR31 with next hop self
   and a new label.

   ASBR31 adds the ASBR11_lpbk_gold route received via EBGP LU from
   ASBR22 to gold TRDB based on the received 'gold SLA' community.
   ASBR31 uses this gold TRDB route to resolve the next hop
   ASBR11_lpbk_gold received on BGP CT route with transport-target gold,
   for the prefix RD:PE11 received over the EBGP multihop CT session,
   thus preserving the end-to-end SLA.  Now ASBR31 readvertises the BGP
   CT route for RD:PE11 with next hop as self thus stitching with the
   BGP LU LSP in AS2.  Intradomain traffic forwarding in AS1 and AS3
   follows the procedures as explained in Illustration of CT Procedures
   (Section 12)

   In cases where an SLA cannot be preserved in AS2 because SLA specific
   tunnels and loopbacks dont exist in AS2, traffic can be carried over
   available SLAs (eg: best-effort SLA) by rewriting the next hop to
   ASBR21 loopback assigned to the available SLA.  This eases migration
   in case of heterogeneous color domains as-well.

13.2.2.  BGP CT - Interop between MPLS and Other Forwarding Technologies

   This section describes how nodes supporting dissimilar encapsulation
   technologies can interoperate with each other when using BGP CT
   family.

13.2.2.1.  Interop Between MPLS and SRv6 Nodes.

   BGP speakers may carry MPLS label and SRv6 SID in BGP CT SAFI 76
   routes using protocol encoding as described in Carrying Multiple
   Encapsulation information (Section 6.1)

   MPLS Labels are carried using RFC 8277 encoding, and SRv6 SID is
   carried using Prefix SID attribute as specified in [RFC9252].

                         RR1--+
                                \  +-------R2  [MPLS + SRv6]

                         R1--------P-------R3  [MPLS only]
                   [MPLS + SRv6]   |
                                   +-------R4  [SRv6 only]

                     <---- Bidirectional Traffic ---->

          Figure 9: BGP CT Interop between MPLS and SRv6 nodes

   This example shows a provider network with a mix of devices with
   different forwarding capabilities.  R1 and R2 support forwarding both
   MPLS and SRv6 packets.  R3 supports forwarding MPLS packets only.  R4
   supports forwarding SRv6 packets only.  All these nodes have BGP
   session with Route Reflector RR1 which reflects routes between these
   nodes with next hop unchanged.  BGP CT family is negotiated on these
   sessions.

   R1 and R2 send and receive both MPLS label and SRv6 SID in the BGP CT
   control plane routes.  This allows them to be ingress and egress for
   both MPLS and SRv6 data planes.  MPLS label is carried using RFC 8277
   encoding, and SRv6 SID is carried using Prefix SID attribute as
   specified in [RFC9252], without Transposition Scheme.  The
   Transposition Length is set to 0 and Transposition Offset is set to 0
   to indicate nothing is transposed and that the entire SRv6 SID value
   is encoded in the SID Information Sub-TLV.  In this way, either MPLS
   or SRv6 forwarding can be used between R1 and R2.

   R1 and R3 send and receive MPLS label in the BGP CT control plane
   routes using RFC 8277 encoding.  This allows them to be ingress and
   egress for MPLS data plane.  R1 will carry SRv6 SID in Prefix-SID
   attribute, which will not be used by R3.  In order to interoperate
   with MPLS only device R3, R1 MUST NOT use SRv6 Transposition scheme
   described in [RFC9252].  The Transposition Length is set to 0 and
   Transposition Offset is set to 0 to indicate nothing is transposed
   and that the entire SRv6 SID value is encoded in the SID Information
   Sub-TLV.  MPLS forwarding will be used between R1 and R3.

   R1 and R4 send and receive SRv6 SID in the BGP CT control plane
   routes using BGP Prefix-SID attribute, without Transposition Scheme.
   This allows them to be ingress and egress for SRv6 data plane.  R4
   will carry the special MPLS Label with value 3 (Implicit-NULL) in RFC
   8277 encoding, which tells R1 not to push any MPLS label towards R4.
   The MPLS Label advertised by R1 in RFC 8277 NLRI will not be used by
   R4.  SRv6 forwarding will be used between R1 and R4.

   Note in this example that R3 and R4 cannot communicate directly with
   each other, because they don't support a common forwarding
   technology.  The BGP CT routes received at R3, R4 from each other
   will remain unusable, due to incompatible forwarding technology.

13.2.2.2.  Interop Between Nodes Supporting MPLS and UDP Tunneling

   This section describes how nodes supporting MPLS forwarding can
   interoperate with other nodes supporting UDP (or IP) tunneling, when
   using BGP CT family.

   MPLS Labels are carried using RFC 8277 encoding, and UDP (or IP)
   tunneling information is carried using TEA attribute or the
   Encapsulation Extended Community as specified in [RFC9012].

                        RR1--+
                               \  +-------R2  [MPLS + UDP]
                                \ |
                        R1--------P-------R3  [MPLS only]
                  [MPLS + UDP]    |
                                  +-------R4  [UDP only]

                    <---- Bidirectional Traffic ---->

         Figure 10: BGP CT Interop between MPLS and UDP tunneling nodes.

   In this example, R1 and R2 support forwarding both MPLS and UDP
   tunneled packets.  R3 supports forwarding MPLS packets only.  R4
   supports forwarding UDP tunneled packets only.  All these nodes have
   BGP session with Route Reflector RR1 which reflects routes between
   these nodes with next hop unchanged.  BGP CT family is negotiated on
   these sessions.

   R1 and R2 send and receive both MPLS label and UDP tunneling info in
   the BGP CT control plane routes.  This allows them to be ingress and
   egress for both MPLS and UDP tunneling data planes.  MPLS label is
   carried using RFC 8277 encoding.  As specified in [RFC9012], UDP
   tunneling information is carried using TEA attribute (code 23) or the
   "barebones" Tunnel TLV carried in Encapsulation Extended Community.
   Either MPLS or UDP tunneled forwarding can be used between R1 and R2.

   R1 and R3 send and receive MPLS label in the BGP CT control plane
   routes using RFC 8277 encoding.  This allows them to be ingress and
   egress for MPLS data plane.  R1 will carry UDP tunneling info in TEA
   attribute, which will not be used by R3.  MPLS forwarding will be
   used between R1 and R3.

   R1 and R4 send and receive UDP tunneling info in the BGP CT control
   plane routes using BGP TEA attribute.  This allows them to be ingress
   and egress for UDP tunneled data plane.  R4 will carry special MPLS
   Label with value 3 (Implicit-NULL) in RFC 8277 encoding, which tells
   R1 not to push any MPLS label towards R4.  The MPLS Label advertised
   by R1 will not be used by R4.  UDP tunneled forwarding will be used
   between R1 and R4.

   Note in this example that R3 and R4 cannot communicate directly with
   each other, because they don't support a common forwarding
   technology.  The BGP CT routes received at R3, R4 from each other
   will remain unusable, due to incompatible forwarding technology.

13.3.  Managing Transport Route Visibility

   This section details the usage of BGP CT RD and label allocation
   modes to calibrate the level of path visibility and the amount of
   route churn in a multi-domain network.

   Consider a multi-domain BGP CT network as illustrated in the figure

   In the above example, both route churn and TE granularity are
   directly proportional to the number of CT labels received.

   Deploying unique RDs is strongly RECOMMENDED because it helps in
   troubleshooting by uniquely identifying the originator of a route and
   avoids path-hiding.

   The above table demonstrates that BGP CT allows an operator to
   control how much path visibility and forwarding diversity is desired
   in the network, for Unicast and Anycast endpoints.

14.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes the following requests of IANA.

14.1.  New BGP SAFI

   IANA is requested to assign a new BGP SAFI code for "Classful
   Transport".  Value 76.

 Registry Group: Subsequent Address Family Identifiers (SAFI) Parameters

 Registry Name: SAFI Values

        Value              Description
       -------------+--------------------------
         76            Classful-Transport SAFI

   This will be used to create new AFI,SAFI pairs for IPv4, IPv6
   Classful Transport families. viz:

   *  "Inet, Classful Transport".  AFI/SAFI = "1/76" for carrying IPv4
      Classful Transport prefixes.

   *  "Inet6, Classful Transport".  AFI/SAFI = "2/76" for carrying IPv6

14.2.  New Format for BGP Extended Community

   IANA is requested to assign a new Format type (Type high = 0xa) of
   Extended Community EXT-COMM [RFC4360] called "Transport Class" from
   the following registries:

      the "BGP Transitive Extended Community Types" registry, and

      the "BGP Non-Transitive Extended Community Types" registry.

   Please assign the same low-order six bits for both allocations.

   This document uses this new Format with subtype 0x2 (route target),
   as a transitive extended community.

   The Route Target thus formed is called "Transport Class" route target
   extended community.

15.  Security Considerations

   Mechanisms described in this document carry Transport routes in a new
   BGP address family.  That minimizes the possibility of these routes
   leaking outside the expected domain or mixing with service routes.

   When redistributing between SAFI 4 and SAFI 76 Classful Transport
   routes, there is a possibility of SAFI 4 routes mixing with SAFI 1
   service routes.  To avoid such scenarios, it is RECOMMENDED that
   implementations support keeping SAFI 4 routes in a separate transport
   RIB, distinct from service RIB that contain SAFI 1 service routes.

   In scenarios where MPLS is enabled on link to a device in an
   untrusted domain, e.g. a PE-CE link or ASBR-ASBR inter-AS link,
   security can be provided against MPLS label spoofing by using MPLS
   context tables as described in MPLS enabled CE (Appendix A.1.2).
   Such that only MPLS traffic with labels advertised to the BGP speaker
   are allowed to forward.  However, the PE may not be able to perform
   any checks based on inner payload in the MPLS packet since it
   performs label swap forwarding.  Such 'inner payload' based checks
   may be offloaded to a downstream node that forwards and processes
   inner payload, e.g., an IP router having full FIB.  These security
   aspects should be considered when using MPLS enabled CE devices

A.1.  Signaling Intent over PE-CE Attachment Circuit

   It may be desirable to allow a CE device to indicate in the data
   packet it sends what treatment it desires (the Intent) when the
   packet is forwarded within the provider network.

   This section describes the mechanisms that enable such signaling.
   These procedures use existing AFIs, and service families (SAFI 1) on
   the PE-CE attachment circuit, with a new BGP attribute.  It does not
   require a forklift upgrade of the PE-CE session with a new set of
   address families.

   the IP header.

   In RFC2474, a Forwarding Class Selector maps to a PHB (Per-hop
   Behavior).  The Transport Class construct is a PHB at transport
   layer.

   Let PE1 be configured to map DSCP1 to Gold Transport class, and DSCP2
   to Bronze Transport class.  Based on the DSCP code point received on
   the IP traffic from CE1, PE1 forwards the IP packet over a Gold or
   Bronze tunnel.  Thus, the forwarding is not based on just the
   destination IP address, but also the DSCP code point.  This is known
   as Class Based Forwarding (CBF).  Today CBF is configured at the PE1
   device roles and CE1 doesn't receive any indication in BGP signaling
   regarding what DSCP code points are being offered by the provider
   network.

   With a BGP MultiNexthop Attribute [MULTI-NH-ATTR] attached to a SAFI
   1 service route, it is possible to extend the PE-CE BGP signalling
   (if used) to communicate such information to the CE1.  In the above
   example, the MNH contains two Next hop Legs, described by two
   Forwarding Instruction TLVs.  Each Next hop Leg contains PE1's
   peering self address in Endpoint Identifier TLV [MNH-EP] , the color
   Gold or Bronze encoded in the Transport class ID TLV [MNH-TC] , and
   associated DSCP code point indicating Gold or Bronze transport class
   encoded in the Payload Encapsulation Info TLV [MNH-ENCAP-DSCP] . This
   allows the CE to discover what transport classes exist in the
   provider network, and which DSCP codepoint to encode so that traffic
   is forwarded using the desired transport class in the provided
   network.

A.1.2.  MPLS-enabled CE

   If the PE-CE link is MPLS enabled, a distinct MPLS label can also be
   used to express Intent in data packets from CE.  Enabling MPLS
   forwarding on PE-CE links comes with some security implications.
   This section gives details on these aspects.

   Consider the ingress PE1 receiving a VPN prefix RD:Pfx1 received with
   VPN label VL1, next hop as PE2 and a mapping community containing TC1
   as 'Transport class ID'.  PE1 can allocate a MPLS Label PVL1 for the
   tuple "VPN Label, PNH Address, Transport class ID" and advertise to
   CE1.






Vairavakkalai & VenkataraExpires 6 January 2024                [Page 57]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   Label PVL1 may identifies a service function at any node in the
   network, e.g. a Firewall device or egress node PE2.  And, for the
   same service prefix, a distinct label may be advertised to different
   CEs, such that incoming traffic from different CEs to the same
   service prefix can be diverted to a distinct devices in the network
   for further processing.  This provides Ingress Peer Engineering
   control to the network.

   PE1 installs a MPLS FIB route for PVL1 with next hop as "Swap VL1,
   Push TL1 towards PE2".  TL1 is the BGP CT label received for the
   tuple 'PE2, TC1'.  In forwarding, when MPLS packet with label PVL1 is
   received from CE1, PVL1 Swaps to label VL1 and pushes the BGP CT
   label TL1.  PE1 advertises the label "PVL1" in the MULTI_NH_ATTR to
   CE1.  PE1 forwards based on MPLS label without performing any IP
   lookup.  This allows for PE1 to be a low IP FIB device and still
   support CBF by using MPLS Label inferred PHB.  The number of MPLS
   Labels consumed at PE1 for this approach will be proportional to the
   number of Service functions and Intents that are exposed to CE1.

   A BGP MultiNexthop Attribute [MULTI-NH-ATTR] is attached to a SAFI 1
   service route to convey the MPLS Label information to CE1.  In the
   above example, the MNH contains two Next hop Legs, described by two
   Forwarding Instruction TLVs.  Each Next hop Leg contains PE1's
   peering self address in Endpoint Identifier TLV [MNH-EP] , the color
   Gold or Bronze encoded in the Transport class ID TLV [MNH-TC] , and
   associated MPLS Label "PVL1" or "PVL2" encoded in the Payload
   Encapsulation Info TLV [MNH-ENCAP-MPLS] . This allows the CE to
   discover what transport classes exist in the provider network, and
   which MPLS Label to encode so that traffic is forwarded using the
   desired transport class.

A.1.2.1.  Secure MPLS Forwarding on Inter-AS Link

   The MPLS enabled PE-CE attachment circuit is considered connecting to
   an untrusted domain.  Such interfaces can be secured against MPLS
   label spoofing by a walled garden approach using "MPLS context
   tables".

   The PE1-CE1 interface can be confined to a specific MPLS context
   table "A" corresponding to the BGP peer.  Such that only the routes
   for labels advertised to CE1 are installed in MPLS context table "A".

   This ensures that if CE1 sends MPLS packet with a label that was not
   advertised to the CE1, the packet will be dropped.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes            July 2023


   Further, the routes for labels PVL1, PVL2 installed in MPLS context
   table "A" can match on 'Bottom of stack' bit being 'one', ensuring a
   MPLS packet is accepted from CE1 only if it has no more than one
   label in the label stack.

   However, the PE itself may not be able to perform any checks based on
   inner payload in the MPLS packet since it performs label swap
   forwarding.  Such inner payload based checks may be offloaded to a
   downstream node that forwards and processes inner payload, e.g. a IP
   FIB router.  These security aspects should be considered when using
   MPLS enabled CE devices.

A.2.  BGP CT Egress TE

   Mechanisms described in [BGP-LU-EPE] also applies to BGP CT family.

   The Peer/32 or Peer/128 EPE route MAY be originated in BGP CT family
   with appropriate Mapping Community (e.g.  transport-target:0:100),
   thus allowing an EPE path to the peer that satisfies the desired SLA.

Appendix B.  Applicability to Intra AS and different Inter AS
             deployments.

   As described in BGP VPN [RFC4364] Section 10, in an option-C network,
   service routes (VPN-IPv4) are neither maintained nor distributed by
   the ASBRs.  Transport routes are maintained in the ASBRs and
   propagated in BGP LU (SAFI 4) or BGP CT (SAFI 76).

   Illustration of CT Procedures (Section 12) illustrates how constructs
   of BGP CT work in an Inter AS option-C deployment.  The BGP CT
   constructs: SAFI 76, Transport Class and Resolution Scheme are used
   in an option-C deployment.

   In Intra AS and Inter AS option-A, option-B scenarios, SAFI 76 may
   not be used, but the Transport Class and Resolution Scheme mechanisms
   are used to provide service mapping.

   This section illustrates how BGP CT constructs work in Intra AS and
   Inter AS option-A, B deployment scenarios.

   This example shows a provider network Autonomous system AS1.  It
   serves customers AS2, AS3.  Traffic direction being described is CE21
   to CE31.  CE31 may request a specific SLA (e.g.  Gold for this
   traffic), when traversing this provider network.

B.1.2.  Transport Layer

   AS1 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels between PE11 and PE12.  And LDP
   tunnels for best effort traffic.

   The network has two Transport classes: Gold with transport class id
   100, Bronze with transport class id 200.  These transport classes are
   provisioned at the PEs.  This creates the Resolution Schemes for
   these transport classes at these PEs.

   Following tunnels exist for Gold transport class.

      PE11_to_PE12_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE12_to_PE11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

   Following tunnels exist for Bronze transport class.

      PE11_to_PE12_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE11_to_PE12_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

   These tunnels are provisioned to belong to transport class 100 or
   200.

B.1.3.  Service Layer route exchange

   Service nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate service families (SAFI 128) on the
   BGP session with RR11.  Service helper RR11 reflects service routes
   between the two PEs with next hop unchanged.  There are no tunnels
   for transport-class 100 or 200 from RR11 to the PEs.

   Forwarding happens using service routes at service nodes PE11, PE12.
   Routes received from CEs are not present in any other nodes' FIB in
   the provider network.

   CE31 advertises a route for example prefix 10.31.31.31 with next hop
   self to PE12.  CE31 can attach a Mapping Community Color:0:100 on
   this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA.  Or, PE11 can
   attach the same using locally configured policies.

   Consider, CE31 is getting VPN service from PE12.  The RD:10.31.31.31
   route is readvertised in SAFI 128 by PE12 with next hop self
   (10.12.12.12) and label V-L1, to RR11 with the Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 attached.  This SAFI 128 route reaches PE11 via RR11 with
   the next hop unchanged as PE12 and label V-L1.  Now PE11 can resolve
   the PNH 10.12.12.12 using PE11_to_PE12_gold RSVP TE LSP.

   The IP FIB at PE11 VRF will have a route for 10.31.31.31 with a next
   hop when resolved using Resolution Scheme belonging to the mapping
   community Color:0:100, points to a PE11_to_PE12_gold tunnel.

   BGP CT SAFI 76 is not used in this Intra AS deployment.  But the
   Transport class and Resolution Scheme constructs are used to preserve
   end-to-end SLA.

   This example shows two provider network Autonomous systems AS1, AS2.
   They serve L3VPN customers AS3, AS4 respectively.  The ASBRs ASBR11
   and ASBR21 have IP VRFs connected directly.  The inter AS link is IP
   enabled with no MPLS forwarding.

   Traffic direction being described is CE31 to CE41.  CE41 may request
   a specific SLA (e.g.  Gold for this traffic), when traversing these
   provider core networks.

B.2.2.  Transport Layer

   AS1 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels between PE11 and ASBR11.  And
   LDP tunnels for best effort traffic.  AS2 uses SRTE intra-domain
   tunnels between ASBR21 and PE21, and L-ISIS for best effort tunnels.

   The networks have two Transport classes: Gold with transport class id
   100, Bronze with transport class id 200.  These transport classes are
   provisioned at the PEs and ASBRs.  This creates the Resolution
   Schemes for these transport classes at these PEs and ASBRs.

   Following tunnels exist for Gold transport class.

      PE11_to_ASBR11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR11_to_PE11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE21_to_ASBR21_gold - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR21_to_PE21_bronze - SRTE tunnel

   These tunnels are provisioned to belong to transport class 100 or
   200.

B.2.3.  Service Layer route exchange

   Service nodes PE11, ASBR11 negotiate service family (SAFI 128) on the
   BGP session with RR11.  Service helper RR11 reflects service routes
   between the PE11 and ASBR11 with next hop unchanged.

   Similarly, in AS2 PE21, ASBR21 negotiate service family (SAFI 128) on
   the BGP session with RR21, which reflects service routes between the
   PE21 and ASBR21 with next hop unchanged.

   CE41 advertises a route for example prefix 10.41.41.41 with next hop
   self to PE21 VRF.  CE41 can attach a Mapping Community Color:0:100 on
   this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA.  Or, PE21 can
   attach the same using locally configured policies.

   Consider, CE41 is getting VPN service from PE21.  The RD:10.41.41.41
   route is readvertised in SAFI 128 by PE21 with next hop self
   (10.21.21.21) and label V-L1, to RR21 with the Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 attached.  This SAFI 128 route reaches ASBR21 via RR21
   with the next hop unchanged as PE21 and label V-L1.  Now ASBR21 can
   resolve the PNH 10.21.21.21 using ASBR21_to_PE21_gold SRTE LSP.

   The IP FIB at ASBR21 VRF will have a route for 10.41.41.41 with a
   next hop resolved using Resolution Scheme associated with mapping
   community Color:0:100, pointing to ASBR21_to_PE21_gold tunnel.

   This route is readvertised by ASBR21 on BGP session inside VRF with
   next hop self.  EBGP session peering on interface address.  ASBR21
   acts like a CE to ASBR11, and the above mentioned process repeats in
   AS1, until the route reaches PE11 and resolves over
   PE11_to_ASBR11_gold RSVP TE tunnel.

   Traffic traverses as IP packet on the following legs: CE31-PE11,
   ASBR11-ASBR21, PE21-CE41.  And uses MPLS forwarding inside AS1, AS2
   core.

   BGP CT SAFI 76 is not used in this Inter AS option-A deployment.  But

   Service nodes PE11, ASBR12 negotiate service family (SAFI 128) on the

   Similarly, in AS2 PE22, ASBR21 negotiate service family (SAFI 128) on
   the BGP session with RR23, which reflects service routes between the

   ASBR21 and ASBR12 negotiate SAFI 128 between them, and readvertise
   L3VPN routes with next hop self, allocating new labels.  EBGP session
   peering on interface address.

   CE41 advertises a route for example prefix 10.41.41.41 with next hop

   Color:0:100 attached.  This SAFI 128 route reaches ASBR21 via RR23
   with the next hop unchanged as PE22 and label V-L1.  Now ASBR21 can
   resolve the PNH 10.22.22.22 using ASBR21_to_PE22_gold SRTE LSP.

   Next, ASBR21 readvertises the RD:10.41.41.41 route with next hop self

   BGP CT SAFI 76 is not used in this Inter AS option-B deployment.  But
   the Transport class and Resolution Scheme constructs are used to
   preserve end-to-end SLA.

Appendix C.  Why reuse RFC 8277 and RFC 4364?

   RFC 4364 is one of the key design patterns produced by networking
   industry.  It introduced virtualization and allowed sharing of
   resources in service provider space with multiple tenant networks,
   providing isolated and secure Layer3 VPN services.  This design
   pattern has been reused since to provide other service layer
   virtualizations like Layer2 virtualization (VPLS, L2VPN, EVPN), ISO
   virtualization, ATM virtualization, Flowspec VPN.

   It is to be noted that these services have different NLRI encoding.
   L3VPN Service family that binds MPLS label to an IP prefix use RFC
   8277 encoding, and others define different NLRI encodings.

   BGP CT reuses RFC 4364 procedures to slice a transport network into
   multiple transport planes that different service routes can bind to,
   using color.

   BGP CT reuses RFC 8277 because it precisely fits the purpose. viz. In
   a MPLS network, BGP CT needs to bind MPLS label for transport
   endpoints which are IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints, and disambiguate between
   multiple instances of those endpoints in multiple transport planes.
   Hence, use of RD:IP_Prefix and carrying a Label for it as specified
   in RFC 8277 works well for this purpose.

   Another advantage of using the precise encoding as defined in RFC
   4364 and RFC 8277 is that it allows to interoperate with BGP speakers
   that support SAFI 128.  This can be useful during transition, until
   all BGP speakers in the network support BGP CT.

   In future, if RFC 8277 evolves into a typed NLRI, that does not carry
   Label in the NLRI, BGP CT will be compatible with that as-well.  In
   essence, BGP CT encoding is compatible with existing deployed
   technologies (RFC 4364, RFC 8277) and will adapt to any changes RFC
   8277 mechanisms undergo in future.

   This is a more pragmatic approach which leverages the benefits of
   time tested design patterns proposed in RFC 4364 and RFC 8277.
   Moreover, this approach greatly reduces operational training costs
   and protocol compatibility considerations, as it complements and
   works well with existing protocol machineries.  This problem does not
   need reinventing the wheel with brand new NLRI and procedures.

   This is a more pragmatic approach, rather than abandoning time tested
   design pattern like RFC 4364 and RFC 8277, just to invent something
   completely new that is not backward compatible with existing
   deployments.  Overloading RFC 8277 NLRI MPLS Label field with
   information related to non MPLS data plane leads to backward
   compatibility issues.

C.1.  Update packing considerations

   BGP CT carries transport class as an attribute.  This means routes
   that don't share the same transport class cannot be packed into same
   Update message.  Update packing in BGP CT will be similar to RFC 8277
   family routes carrying attributes like communities or extended
   communities.  Service families like SAFI 128 have considerably more
   scale than transport families like SAFI 4 or SAFI 76, which carry
   only loopbacks.  Update packing mechanisms that scale for SAFI 128
   routes will scale similarly for SAFI 76 routes also.

   The document Intent-aware Routing using Color [Intent-Routing-Color]
   section 6.3.2.1 suggests scaling numbers for transport network where
   BGP CT can be deployed.  Experiments were conducted with this scale
   to find the convergence time with BGP CT for those scaling numbers.
   Scenarios involving BGP CT carrying IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints with MPLS
   label, and IPv6 endpoints with SRv6 SID were tested.

   Tests were conducted with 1.9 million BGP CT route scale (387K
   endpoints in 5 transport classes).  Initial convergence time for all
   cases was less than 2 minutes, This experiment proves that carrying
   transport class information as an attribute keeps BGP convergence
   within acceptable range.  Details of the experiment and test results
   are available in BGP CT Update packing Test Results
   [BGP-CT-UPDATE-PACKING-TEST].

   Further, even in today's BGP LU deployments each egress node
   originates BGP LU route for it's loopback, with some attributes like
   community identifying the originating node or region, and AIGP
   attribute.  These attributes may be unique per egress node, thus do
   not help with update packing in transport layer family routes.

Appendix D.  Scaling using BGP MPLS Namespaces

   This section describes how scaling is achieved in an Inter domain
   MPLS network, where a domain is an AS or IGP area.  Domain boundary
   is demarcated by a BN performing BGP next hop self action on the
   transport route.

   It considers the scenario suggested in the document Intent-aware
   Routing using Color [Intent-Routing-Color] section 6.3.2.1. where
   300K nodes exist in the network with 5 transport classes.

   This may result in 1.5M transport layer routes and MPLS transit
   routes in all Border Nodes in the network, which may overwhelm the
   nodes' MPLS forwarding resources.

   This section explains how mechanism described in [MPLS-NAMESPACES] is
   used to scale such a network.  This approach reduces the number of
   PNHs that are globally visible in the network, thus reducing
   forwarding resource usage network wide.  Service route state is kept
   confined closer to network edge, and any churn is confined within the
   region containing the point of failure, which improves convergence.

   In order to achieve these scaling benefits, new functionality is
   required only at a Region's Border Nodes and the Regional RRs.  All
   other nodes can remain legacy nodes, and still get the scaling and
   convergence benefits of this mechanism.  This is mainly advantageous
   to ingress and egress PE devices which may be low end devices not
   capable of pushing deep label stacks or supporting large number of
   ECMP next hops.  They can enjoy the scaling benefits without needing
   software upgrades.

D.1.  Illustration.

   Let us consider the decomposition of this example network with 300K
   nodes to be such that there are 300 domains containing 1000 nodes
   each.  The mechanism described here will reduce the forwarding
   resource usage in all Border Nodes to become a function of number of
   domains (300) instead of number of nodes (300K).  Thus, drastically
   reducing MPLS transit routes from 1.5M to 1500.  The Border Nodes and
   Regional RRs in a Region do the job of abstracting the 1000 PE
   loopbacks from the rest of the network.  The rest of the network sees
   this region as 1 BGP next hop, and not as 1000 BGP next hops.

            Figure 17: Reference Topology, BGP MPLS Namespaces

                       Figure 3: BGP MPLS Namespaces.

   This topology shows a cross section of the network with focus on two
   domains Domain1 and Domain3 connected via a backbone domain Domain2.
   Rest of the domains are not shown for brevity.  The border nodes have
   forwarding state pertaining to all domains in the network.  The
   control plane and forwarding plane state in node BN21 can be examined
   to determine the MPLS scaling characteristics of the network.

   L3VPN Service routes are present only at ingress and egress PEs.
   L3VPN family (SAFI 128) is negotiated between PE11..PE11000 and
   regional route reflector RR11.  RR11 has multihop EBGP peering with
   RR31 and negotiates SAFI 128.  RR31 further peers with all PEs
   PE31..PE31000 in Domain3.

   At the Transport layer - in Domain1, PE11..PE11000 negotiate BGP
   families (SAFI 4, SAFI 76) with BN11, BN12.  In Domain2, BN11 and
   BN12 similarly negotiate the transport families with BN21, which in
   turn peers with BN31 and BN32.  In Domain3, BN31 and BN32 peer with
   PEs PE31..PE31000.  Each of these BNs change BGP next hop to self,
   when re advertising the SAFI 4, SAFI 76 transport routes.

   When all nodes loopback addresses are visible throughout the network,
   it will result in 1.5M transport layer routes and MPLS transit routes
   in BN21.

   Following sections describe the control plane and forwarding plane
   mechanics to reduce this to 1500 routes, when MPLS Namespaces is
   deployed in this network.

   Traffic direction being described is CE41 to CE31.  Reverse direction
   would work in similar way.

D.3.  Context Protocol Nexthop Address (CPNH)

   A MPLS Namespace is identified by a Context PNH address.  In MPLS
   forwarding, labels are locally significant to the node advertising
   it.  E.g. labels in default/global MPLS Namespace are scoped by the
   node's loopback address.  The labels belonging to a MPLS Namespace
   are locally significant in scope of the Context PNH address.

   A UHP label called as "Context Label" is advertised for the CPNH in a
   transport protocol, which points to the MPLS Namespace forwarding
   context.  When Context label is received as outer label in a MPLS
   packet, it is Popped, and lookup is performed for the MPLS label that
   appears in the MPLS Namespace identified by the CPNH.

   In this example, CPNH is an anycast IP address that represents set of
   PEs in a domain.  E.g.  CPNH1 represent all PEs in Domain1.  And
   CPNH3 represents all PEs in Domain3.

D.4.  Service Forwarding Helper, and Changes to Transport Layer.

   The border nodes BN11, BN12 maintain the forwarding context for MPLS
   Namespace identified by CPNH1.  They advertise CPNH1 in transport
   layer routes like SAFI 4 or SAFI 76 with a UHP Context Label CL1.
   Any transport layer protocol may be used to advertise the UHP Context
   Label for the CPNH.

   In this way, BN11 and BN12 serve as Service Forwarding Helpers for
   CPNH1 MPLS Namespace.  They attract traffic that remote devices send
   towards the BGP next hop CPNH1, and forward the MPLS packets received
   with the MPLS labels belonging to the MPLS Namespace identified by
   CPNH1.

   The individual loopback addresses of the PEs need not be advertised
   outside the local region.  E.g.  PE11..PE11000 are not advertised
   beyond BN11, BN12.  Only CPNH1 and RR11 addresses are advertised out.
   RR1 is used for the control plane peering and CPNH1 is used as a
   forwarding anchor point.

   Similarly, Domain3 advertises only RR31 and CPNH3 to Domain2.  This
   significantly reduces the transport route scale and MPLS forwarding
   resource usage at the border nodes throughout the network.

D.5.  BGP MPLS Namespace Address family (AFI:16399, SAFI:128)

   In Domain1, the regional route reflector RR11 negotiates MPLS
   Namespace Signaling address family with the border nodes BN11, BN12.
   RR11 is an external label allocator for the MPLS Namespace identified
   by CPNH1.  RR1 advertises in the MPLS Namespace address family, the
   labels it allocated in scope of CPNH1.  These routes are advertised
   with a route target that identifies CPNH1.  BN11 and BN12 use this
   route target to import the label route into the forwarding context
   associated with CPNH1.

   Similarly, in Domain3, RR31 negotiates MPLS Namespace Signaling
   address family with the border nodes BN31, BN32.

D.6.  Changes to Service Layer Route Exchange

   When RR11 re-advertises to RR31 a VPN route RD:Pfx1 received with
   label VL1 from egress PE11 in Domain1, it sets BGP next hop to CPNH1,
   and advertises a new label PL1.  This label PL1 is allocated within
   the scope of CPNH1 namespace.

   The label PL1 is advertised to BN1, BN2 in MPLS Namespace address
   family with a route target identifying CPNH1, and BGP next hop PE11
   and label VL1 that were received from the egress PE.  BN1 and BN2
   resolve the path to that BGP next hop PE11 and use as next hop for
   the PL1 route installed in CPNH1 forwarding context.

   The remote PEs in Domain3 consume the BGP updates from Domain1
   following regular procedures for SAFI 128.  When resolving the BGP
   next hop CPNH1, they will push the context label that lands the
   traffic into the correct forwarding context in one of the border
   nodes.

D.7.  Analysis of Forwarding Behavior

   The forwarding behavior thus achieved is similar to Inter AS option-
   b, without carrying any service routes at the border nodes.  Further,
   the MPLS namespace labels are installed in all the border nodes,
   which allows for quicker traffic convergence in case of border node
   failure.  The number of border nodes can be increased in a scale out
   manner, which gives a cookie cutter template to scale a network
   region.

   In conclusion, this mechanism provides both scaling and convergence
   benefits for the MPLS network, and allows to support huge scale
   networks.

Appendix E.  BGP CT deployment in SRv6 networks

   This section describes BGP CT deployment in SRv6 multi-domain network
   using Inter-AS Option C architecture.

E.1.  SID stacking approach

   This approach uses stacking of service SRv6 SID over transport SRv6
   SID.  Transport layer SIDs of types End, End.B6.Encaps defined in
   [RFC8986], and type END.REPLACE* defined in [SRV6-INTER-DOMAIN] are
   carried in SAFI 76.  Service SID is carried in a service family like
   SAFI 1 or SAFI 128.

   In this approach, the number of Service SIDs required at the egress
   SN is equal to service functions (e.g.  Prefix, VRF or Next hop) and
   the number of Transport SIDs are equal to the number of transport
   classes.

              -------Forwarding Direction----->

     Figure 18: Reference Topology, BGP CT in SRv6 Only Data plane

   In the above topology, there are two AS domains, AS1 and AS2.  These
   are pure IPv6 domains, with no MPLS enabled.  Inter-AS links between
   AS1 and AS2 are also enabled with IPv6 forwarding.

   Intra-AS nodes in AS1 and AS2 speak IBGP CT (AFI: 2, SAFI: 76) and
   ISIS-SRv6 between them.  The Inter-AS nodes ASBR1, ASBR2 speak EBGP
   CT (AFI: 2, SAFI:76) between them.  Transport Classes Gold (100) and
   Bronze (200) are provisioned in all PEs and ASBRs.  All BGP CT
   advertisements in this example carry a MPLS label value of 3
   (Implicit Null) in the NLRI encoding.

   Reachability between PE1 and PE2 is formed using BGP CT family.
   Service families like IPv4 unicast (AFI: 1, SAFI: 1) and L3VPN (AFI:
   2, SAFI: 128) is negotiated on multihop EBGP session between PE1 and
   PE2.  These service routes carry service SID to identify service
   functions at the advertising PE, and mapping community to identify
   the desired Intent.

   The following SRv6 locators are provisioned:

   Architecturally, the forwarding semantic of End.REPLACE SID operation
   is similar to Label SWAP operation in MPLS data plane.  When a route
   received with End SID (e.g.  PE2-SRv6-gold or PE2-SRv6-bronze
   transport SIDs) is readvertised with next hop self, a IPv6 forwarding
   entry is emitted with a forwarding semantic of End.B6.Encaps
   operation, which means: Update IPv6 DA with Next Segment in SRH, and
   Encapsulate SRv6 SID corresponding to the correct transport class.
   This can be seen in IPv6 FIB of ASBR2 during "BGP CT processing at
   ASBR2" in the following illustration:

   The following service layer SRv6 End.DT4 SIDs are provisioned:

      PE2-SRv6-S1-DT4 : PE2 End.DT4 SID for service S1

   ISIS between Intra-AS nodes and the established SRv6 tunnel to the
   node's loopback will be installed into the corresponding TRDB based
   on color.

   The illustrations that follow, show how the BGP CT route for gold
   transport plane is originated, import processing done and propagated
   through this network.  Similar processing is followed for the bronze
   transport plane route as well.

   Firstly, PE2 originates BGP CT route for its transport layer
   endpoints like Loopback address with SRv6 SID information to ASBR2 as
   shown below.

     IBGP CT routes from PE2 to ASBR2

         RD1:PE2-LPBK,

           Prefix-SID: PE2-SRv6-gold

         RD2:PE2-LPBK,
           transport-target:0:200,

     PE2: IPv6 FIB for SRv6

         [BGP CT] PE2-SRv6-S1-DT4
           NH: Decap, Perform service S1

   When ASBR2 receives the IBGP CT advertisement for gold route from
   PE2, it performs import processing and next hop resolution for the
   endpoint PE2-LPBK in the gold TRDB based on its transport-
   target:0:100.  This would resolve over the ISIS-SRv6 route in gold
   TRDB and pick "Gold-SRv6-Tunnel-to-PE2" tunnel.

   On successful resolution, a IPv6 transit route for ASBR2-SRv6-PE2-
   gold-replace/128 is installed in the global IPv6 FIB with "Gold-SRv6-
   Tunnel-to-PE2" tunnel as next hop, enabling SRv6 forwarding for gold
   SLA.  The BGP CT routes for RD1:PE2-LPBK is further advertised
   towards ASBR1 via EBGP CT as shown below.  During this
   readvertisement, the next hop is set to self, and SID is rewritten to
   ASBR2-SRv6-gold-Replace.

         RD2:PE2-LPBK,
           transport-target:0:200,
           Prefix-SID: ASBR1-SRv6-PE2-bronze-Replace,

     ASBR1: IPv6 FIB for SRv6

           NH: ASBR2_InterAS_Link
           SID op: ReplaceSID(ASBR2-SRv6-PE2-bronze-Replace)

   When PE1 receives this IBGP CT advertisement from ASBR1, it resolves
   the next hop ASBR1-LPBK in the gold TRDB based on its transport-
   target:0:100.  This would resolve over the ISIS-SRv6 route in gold
   TRDB and pick "Gold-SRv6-Tunnel-to-ASBR1".

   This forms the end-to-end Gold SLA path from PE1 to PE2.  The gold
   BGP CT route for PE2-LPBK is installed in gold TRDB, and can be used
   for resolving service route next hops.  The Transport layer SIDs are
   replaced at each border node, which reduces the number of SID decaps
   required at the egress PE.

   Furthermore, any service routes received with next hop as PE2-LPBK
   and Mapping Community as Color:0:100 indicating Gold SLA will use the
   Resolution Scheme associated with its Mapping Community to resolve
   over the PE2-LPBK CT route installed in the gold TRDB, and push the
   SRv6-gold SID stack to reach PE2.

   Similarly, any service routes received with next hop as PE2-LPBK and
   Mapping Community as Color:0:200 indicating Bronze SLA will use the
   Resolution Scheme associated with its Mapping Community to resolve
   over the PE2-LPBK CT route installed in the bronze TRDB, and push the
   SRv6-bronze SID stack to reach PE2.  This is shown below.

 BGP Service routes advertisement from PE2 to PE1:

      SVC_PFX1,
        color:0:100,
        Prefix-SID: PE2-SRv6-S1-DT4,
        NH: PE2-LPBK

      SVC_PFX2,
        color:0:200,
        Prefix-SID: PE2-SRv6-S1-DT4,
        NH: PE2-LPBK

 PE1: Service routes FIB

      [BGP INET] SVC_PFX1, color:0:100
        NH: EncapSID "PE2-SRv6-S1-DT4, ASBR1-SRv6-gold-Repace, Gold-SRv6-Tunnel-to-ASBR1(outer)"

      [BGP INET] SVC_PFX2, color:0:200
        NH: EncapSID "PE2-SRv6-S1-DT4, ASBR1-SRv6-bronze-Replace, Bronze-SRv6-Tunnel-to-ASBR1(outer)"

   The operational, scaling and convergence aspects of this approach are
   similar to the aspects of applying BGP CT procedures to the MPLS data
   plane.

E.2.  Color-encoded Service SID (CPR) Approach

   CPR is defined in the document: Colorful Prefix Routing for SRv6
   based services [Colorful-Prefix-Routing-SRv6], and uses IPv6 Unicast
   (AFI/SAFI = 2/1) as a transport family.  CPR mechanism does not use
   BGP CT (SAFI 76) address family.

   CPR uses color encoded SRv6 service SIDs to determine the intent-
   aware transport paths for the service, without a separate transport
   SRv6 SID.  It routes using "Colorful Prefix" locators in the
   transport layer, which are carried in the IPv6 Unicast BGP family.

   A Next hop Resolution Scheme similar to that of BGP CT Section 5 is
   used on IPv6 Unicast family to resolve "Colorful Prefix" locator
   routes that carry a mapping community to intent-aware paths in each
   domain.

   By virtue of the CPR SID allocation scheme, the service SIDs inherit
   the Intent of the corresponding Colorful Prefix route just by
   performing longest prefix match in forwarding plane.

E.2.1.  Analysis of CPR Approach

   The CPR approach can be used to support intent driven routing while
   minimizing SRv6 encapsulation overhead, at the cost of careful SID
   numbering and planning.  The state in the transport network is a
   function of total number of Colorful Prefixes.

   In the CPR approach, typically one service SID is allocated for each
   service function (e.g.  VRF) which is associated with a specific
   intent.  In some special scenarios, for example, when different
   service routes in the same VRF are with different intents, a unique
   service SID would need to be allocated for each intent associated
   with the VRF.

   However, the CPR mechanism preserves BGP PIC (Prefix scale
   Independent Convergence) for the egress SN failure scenario where
   only Colorful Prefix routes need to be withdrawn.

   CPR achieves strict Intent based forwarding for the service routes.
   Fallback to best effort transport class is achieved by numbering all
   SRv6 Colorful Prefix locators at the egress SN to fall in the same
   subnet as the SRv6 locator that uses best effort transport class.
   Customized intent fallback between different color transport classes
   may be achieved by allocating a CPR prefix for each such intent
   fallback policy, and advertising that CPR prefix with an appropriate
   mapping community, that maps to a customized resolution scheme.
   Alternatively, the intent fallback policy may be provisioned on the
   ingress nodes directly.

   Further, IPv6 Unicast family is widely deployed to carry Internet
   Service routes.  Repurposing IPv6 Unicast family to carry Transport
   routes also may impact the operational complexity and security
   aspects in the network.
