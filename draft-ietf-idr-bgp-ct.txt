                        draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ct-19

Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "Intent Driven
   Service Mapping", that uses BGP to express intent based association
   of overlay routes, with underlay routes having specific Traffic
   Engineering (TE) characteristics, that satisfy a certain Service
   Level Agreement (SLA).  The document achieves this by defining new
   constructs, to group underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE
   characteristics into identifiable classes (called, Transport
   Classes), that overlay routes use as an ordered set to resolve
   reachability (Resolution Schemes) towards service endpoints.  These
   constructs can be used, e.g., to realize the "IETF Network Slice"
   defined in TEAS Network Slices framework.

   This document specifies protocol procedures for BGP that enable
   dissemination of service mapping information in a network that may
   span multiple cooperating administrative domains.  These domains may
   be administered either by the same provider or by closely
   coordinating providers.  A new BGP address family that leverages RFC
   4364 procedures and follows RFC 8277 NLRI encoding, is defined to
   advertise underlay routes with its identified class.  This new
   address family is called "BGP Classful Transport", a.k.a., BGP CT.

1.  Introduction

   Provider networks, typically span across multiple domains where, each
   domain can either represent an Autonomous system (AS) or an Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) region within an AS.  In these networks,
   several services are provisioned between different pairs of service
   endpoints (e.g., Provider Edge (PE) nodes), that can either be in the
   same domain or across different domains.

   This document realizes "Intent" as defined in [RFC9315] and
   prescribes constructs and procedures that enable provider networks to
   be able to forward service traffic based on service specific intent,
   end-to-end across service endpoints.

   The mechanisms described in this document achieve "Intent Driven
   Service Mapping" between any pair of service endpoints by:

      provisioning end-to-end "intent-aware" paths (e.g., low latency
      path, best effort path) using BGP,

      expressing a desired intent (e.g., use low latency path with
      fallback to the best effort path), and

      forwarding service traffic "only" using end-to-end "intent-aware"
      paths honoring that desired intent.

   The constructs and procedures defined in this document apply
   homogeneously to intra-AS as well as inter-AS (a.k.a. multi-AS)
   Option A, Option B and Option C (Section 10, [RFC4364]) style
   deployments in provider networks.

   Provider networks that are deployed using such styles, provision
   intra-domain transport tunnels between a pair of endpoints, typically
   a service node or a border node, that service traffic use to traverse
   that domain.  These tunnels are signaled using various tunneling
   protocols depending on the forwarding architecture used in the
   domain, which can be Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet
   Protocol version 4 (IPv4), or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

   The mechanisms defined in this document are agnostic to the tunneling
   technologies.  These can be applied homogeneously to intra-domain
   tunneling technologies used in brownfield networks as well as
   greenfield networks.  For clarity, only some tunneling technologies
   are detailed in this document.  For example, MPLS Traffic Engineering
   (TE) examples are described.  Other tunneling technologies have been
   described in detail in other documents and only an overview has been
   included in this document.  For example, the details for Segment
   Routing (SRv6) are provided in [BGP-CT-SRv6], and an overview is
   provided in Section 7.13.

   Customers need to be able to signal Intent to the network, and the
   network needs to have constructs able to enact the customer's intent.
   The network constructs defined in this document are used to classify
   and group these intra-domain tunnels based on their TE
   characteristics (e.g., low latency), into identifiable classes, that
   can pass "intent-aware" traffic.  These constructs enable services to
   express their desired intent on using one or more identifiable
   classes, and mechanisms to selectively map traffic onto "intent-
   aware" tunnels for these classes.

   This document introduces a new BGP address family, called "BGP
   Classful Transport", that extends/stitches intent-aware intra-domain
   tunnels that belong to the same class across domain boundaries, to
   establish end-to-end intent-aware paths between service endpoints.

   [Intent-Routing-Color] describes various use cases and applications
   of the procedures described in this document.

2.1.  Definitions and Notations

   BGP Community Like Attribute (CLA) : A BGP attribute that carries
   community.  Examples of BGP CLA are: Communities (attr code 8),
   Extended Communities (attr code 16), IPv6 Address Specific Extended
   Community (attr code 25), Large community (attr code 32).

   color:0:100 : This notation denotes a Color extended community as
   defined in RFC 9012 with the Flags field set to 0 and the color field
   set to 100.

   End to End Tunnel: A tunnel spanning several adjacent tunnel domains
   created by "stitching" them together using MPLS labels (or an
   equivalent identifier based on the forwarding architecture).

   Import processing: Receive side processing of an overlay route,
   including things like import policy application, resolution scheme
   selection and nexthop resolution.

   Intent: A set of operational goals (that a network should meet) and
   outcomes (that a network is supposed to deliver) defined in a
   declarative manner without specifying how to achieve or implement
   them, as defined in Section 2 of [RFC9315].

   Mapping Community: Any BGP CLA (e.g., Community, Extended Community)
   on an overlay route that maps to a Resolution Scheme. e.g.,
   color:0:100, transport-target:0:100.

   Resolution Scheme: A construct comprising of an ordered set of TRDBs
   to resolve next hop reachability, for realizing a desired intent.

   Service Family: A BGP address family used for advertising routes for
   destinations in "data traffic" (e.g.  AFI/SAFIs 1/1 or 1/128).

   Transport Family: A BGP address family used for advertising tunnels,
   which are in turn used by service routes for resolution (e.g.  AFI/
   SAFIs 1/4 or 1/76).

   Transport Tunnel : A tunnel over which a service may place traffic.
   Such a tunnel can be provisioned or signaled using a variety of means
   (e.g., Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), UDP, LDP, RSVP-TE, IGP
   FLEX-ALGO or SRTE).

   Tunnel Route: A Route to Tunnel Destination/Endpoint that is
   installed at the headend (ingress) of the tunnel.

   Tunnel Domain: A domain of the network containing Service Nodes (SNs)
   and Border Nodes (BNs) under a single administrative control that has
   tunnels between them.

   Transport Class: A construct to group transport tunnels offering
   similar SLA.

   Transport Class RT: A Route Target Extended Community used to
   identify a specific Transport Class.

   transport-target:0:100 : This notation denotes a Transport Class RT
   extended community as defined in this document with the "Transport
   Class ID" field set to 100.

   Transport Route Database (TRDB): At the SN and BN, a Transport Class
   has an associated Transport Route Database that collects its Tunnel
   Routes.

   Transport Plane: An end-to-end plane consisting of transport tunnels
   belonging to the same Transport Class.

            Figure 1: BGP CT Overview with Example Topology

   To achieve end-to-end "Intent Driven Service Mapping", this document
   defines the following constructs and BGP extensions:

      The "Transport Class" (Section 4) construct to group underlay
      tunnels with sufficiently similar TE characteristics.

      The "Resolution Scheme" (Section 5) construct for overlay routes
      with Mapping Community to resolve next hop reachability from
      either one or an ordered set of Transport Classes.

      The "BGP Classful Transport" (Section 6) family to extend these
      constructs to adjacent domains.

   Figure 1 depicts the intra-AS and inter-AS application of these
   constructs.  It uses an example topology of Inter-AS option C network
   with two AS domains.  AS1 is a RSVP-TE network, AS2 is a SRTE
   network.  BGP CT and BGP LU are transport layer families used between

   the two AS domains.  IP1, IP2, IP3 are service prefixes (AFI/SAFI:
   1/1) behind egress PE11.  SN11 is an ingress PE with intra domain
   reachability to PE11.  PE21 is an ingress PE with inter domain
   reachability to PE11.

   The tunneling mechanisms are made "Transport Class" aware.  They
   publish their underlay tunnels for a Transport Class into an
   associated "Transport Route Database" (TRDB) (Section 4.2).  In
   Figure 1, RSVP-TE publishes its underlay tunnels into TRDBs created
   for Transport Class 100 and 200 at BN11 and SN11 within AS1;
   Similarly, SR-TE publishes its underlay tunnels into TRDBs created
   for Transport Class 100 and 200 at PE21 within AS2.

   The underlay route in a TRDB can be advertised in BGP to extend an
   underlay tunnel to adjacent domains.  A new BGP transport layer
   address family called "BGP Classful Transport", aka BGP CT (AFI/SAFIs
   1/76, 2/76) is defined for this purpose.  BGP CT makes it possible to
   advertise multiple tunnels to the same destination address, thus
   avoiding the need for multiple loopbacks on the Egress Service Node
   (eSN).

   BGP CT family carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain
   boundaries, which is parallel to BGP LU (AFI/SAFIs 1/4 or 2/4).  It
   disseminates "Transport Class" information for the transport prefixes
   across the participating domains, which is not possible with BGP LU.
   This makes the end-to-end network a "Transport Class" aware tunneled
   network.

   In Figure 1, BGP CT routes are originated at BN11 in AS1 with next
   hop "self" towards BN21 in AS2 to extend available RSVP-TE tunnels
   for Transport Class 100 and 200 in AS1.  BN21 propagates these routes
   with next hop "self" onto PE21, which resolves the BGP CT routes over
   SRTE tunnels belonging to same transport class.

   Overlay routes carry sufficient indication of the desired Transport
   Classes using a BGP community which assumes the role of as a "Mapping
   Community".  A Resolution Scheme is identified by its "Mapping
   Community", where its configuration can either be auto-generated
   based on TC ID or done manually.

   The following text illustrates CT architecture having the property of
   providing tiered fallback options at a per-route granularity.  In
   Figure 1, the Resolution Schemes are shown and the following next hop
   resolutions are done by SN11 and PE21 for the service routes of
   prefixes IP1, IP2, IP3:

      Resolve IP1 next hop over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
      Class 100 with fallback to TRDB for best effort.

      Resolve IP2 next hop over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
      Class 200 with fallback to TRDB for best effort.

      Resolve IP3 next hop over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
      Class 100 with fallback to TRDB for Transport Class 200.

   In Figure 1, SN11 resolves IP1, IP2 and IP3 directly over RSVP-TE
   tunnels in AS1.  PE21 resolves IP1, IP2 and IP3 over extended BGP-CT
   tunnels that resolve over SR-TE tunnels in AS2.

   This document describes procedures using MPLS forwarding
   architecture.  However, these procedures would work in a similar
   manner for non-MPLS forwarding architectures as well.  Section 7.13
   describes the application of BGP CT over SRv6 data plane.

4.  Transport Class

   Transport Class is a construct that groups transport tunnels offering
   similar SLA within the administrative domain of a provider network or
   closely coordinated provider networks.

   A Transport Class is uniquely identified on a box by a 32-bit
   "Transport Class ID", that is assigned by the operator.  The operator
   consistently provisions a Transport Class on participating nodes (SNs
   and BNs) in a domain with its unique Transport Class ID.

   A Transport Class is also configured with RD and import/export RT
   attributes.  Creation of a Transport Class instantiates its
   corresponding TRDB and Resolution Schemes on that node.

   All nodes within a domain agree on a common Transport Class ID
   namespace.  But two co-operating domains may not always agree on the
   same namespace.  Procedures to manage differences in Transport Class
   ID namespaces between co-operating domains are specified in
   Section 11.2.2.

   Transport Class ID conveys the Color of tunnels in a Transport Class.
   The terms 'Transport Class ID' and 'Color' are used interchangeably
   in this document.

4.1.  Classifying TE tunnels

   TE tunnels can be classified into a Transport Class based on the TE
   attributes they possess and the TE characteristics that the operator
   defines for that Transport Class.  Due to the fact that multiple TE
   tunneling protocols exist, their TE attributes and characteristics
   may not be equal but sufficiently similar.  Some examples of such
   classifications are as follows:



Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


      Tunnels (RSVP-TE, IGP FLEX-ALGO, SR-TE) with a latency no greater
      than 100ms.

      RSVP-TE Tunnels that only go over admin-group with Green links.

      Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE) that offer Fast Reroute.

      Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE) that share resources in the network based
      on Shared Risk Link Groups defined by TE policy.

      Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE, BGP-CT) that avoid certain nodes in the
      network based on RSVP-TE ERO, SR-TE policy or BGP policy.

   An operator may configure an SN/BN to classify a tunnel into an
   appropriate Transport Class.  How exactly these tunnels are made
   Transport Class aware is implementation specific and outside the
   scope of this document.

   When a tunnel is made Transport Class aware, it causes the Tunnel
   Route to be installed in the corresponding TRDB of that Transport
   Class.  These routes are used to resolve overlay routes including BGP
   CT, which may be further readvertised to adjacent domains to extend
   these tunnels.  While readvertising BGP CT routes, the "Transport
   Class" identifier is encoded as part of the Transport Class RT, which
   is a new Route Target extended community.

   An SN/BN receiving the transport routes via BGP with sufficient
   signaling information to identify a Transport Class can associate
   those tunnel routes to the corresponding Transport Class.  E.g., for
   Classful Transport family (AFI/SAFIs, 1/76 or 2/76) routes, the
   Transport Class RT indicates the Transport Class.  For BGP LU family
   (AFI/SAFIs, 1/4 or 2/4) routes, import processing based on
   Communities or Inter-AS source-peer may be used to place the route in
   the desired Transport Class.

   When the tunnel route is received via [SRTE] with "Color:Endpoint" as
   the NLRI that encodes the Transport Class as an integer 'Color', the
   'Color' is mapped to a Transport Class during the import processing.
   The SRTE tunnel route for this 'Endpoint' is installed in the
   corresponding TRDB.  The SRTE tunnel will be extended by a BGP CT
   advertisement with NLRI 'RD:Endpoint', Transport Class RT and a new
   label.  The MPLS swap route thus installed for the new label will pop
   the label and forward the decapsulated traffic into the path
   determined by the SRTE route for further encapsulation.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   [PCEP-SRTE-COLOR] extends Path Computation Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) to carry SRTE Color.  This color association learnt
   from PCEP is also mapped to a Transport Class thus associating the
   PCEP driven SRTE LSP with the desired Transport Class.

   Similarly, [PCEP-RSVP-COLOR] extends PCEP to carry RSVP Color.  This
   color association learnt from PCEP is also mapped to a Transport
   Class thus associating the PCEP driven RSVP-TE LSP with the desired
   Transport Class.

4.2.  Transport Route Database

   A Transport Route Database (TRDB) is a logical collection of
   transport routes pertaining to the same Transport Class.  In any
   node, every Transport Class has an associated TRDB.  Resolution
   Schemes resolve next hop reachability for EP using the transport
   routes within the scope of the TRDBs.

   Tunnel endpoint addresses (EP) in a TRDB belong to the "Provider
   Namespace" representing the core transport region.

   An implementation may realize the TRDB e.g., as a "Routing Table"
   referred in Section 9.1.2.1 of RFC4271 (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1.2.1) which is "only" used for
   resolving next hop reachability in control plane with no footprint in
   forwarding plane.  However, an implementation may choose a different
   methodology to realize this logical construct while still adhering to
   the procedures defined in this document.

   SNs or BNs originate routes for 'Classful Transport' address family
   from the TRDB.  These routes have NLRI "RD:Endpoint", Transport Class
   RT and an MPLS label (or an identifier that represents an equivalent
   of a label in a different forwarding architecture).  'Classful
   Transport' family routes received with Transport Class RT are
   imported into its corresponding TRDB.

4.3.  "Transport Class" Route Target Extended Community

   This section defines a new type of Route Target, called "Transport
   Class" Route Target Extended Community.  The procedures for use of
   this extended community with BGP CT routes (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 and 2/76)
   are described below.

   "Transport Class" Route Target Extended Community is a transitive
   extended community EXT-COMM [RFC4360] of extended type, which has the
   format as shown in Figure 2.

   This new Route Target Format has the following encoding:

   Transport Class ID: This field is encoded in 4 octets.

      This field contains the "Transport Class" identifier,
      which is an unsigned 32-bit integer.

      This document reserves the Transport class ID value 0 to
      represent "Best Effort Transport Class ID".

       Figure 2: "Transport Class" Route Target Extended Community

   The VPN route import/export mechanisms as specified in BGP VPN
   [RFC4364] and the Constrained Route Distribution mechanisms as
   specified in Route Target Constrain [RFC4684] can be applied to BGP
   CT routes (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 and 2/76) using its Transport Class Route
   Target Extended community.

   A BGP speaker that implements Route Target Constrain [RFC4684] MUST
   also apply the RTC procedures to the Transport Class Route Target
   Extended communities carried on BGP CT routes (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 and
   2/76).

   The Transport Class Route Target Extended community is carried on
   Classful Transport family routes and is used to associate them with
   appropriate TRDBs at receiving BGP speakers.

   Defining a new type code for the Transport Class Route Target
   Extended community avoids conflicts with any VPN Route Target
   assignments already in use for service families.

   This document also reserves the Non-Transitive version of Transport
   Class extended community (Section 13.2.1.1.2) just to block the
   codepoint in the non-transitive namespace also.  The "Non-Transitive
   Transport Class" Route Target Extended Community is not used.  If
   received, it is considered equivalent in functionality to the
   Transitive Transport Class Route Target Extended Community, except
   for the difference in Transitive bit flag.

5.  Resolution Scheme

   Resolution Scheme is a construct that consists of a specific TRDB or
   an ordered set of TRDBs.  An overlay route is associated with a
   resolution scheme during import processing, based on Mapping
   Community on the route.

   Resolution Schemes enable a BGP speaker to resolve next hop
   reachability for overlay routes over the appropriate underlay tunnels
   within the scope of the TRDBs.  Longest Prefix Match (LPM) of the
   next hop is performed within the identified TRDB.

   An implementation may provide an option for the overlay route to
   resolve over less preferred Transport Classes, should the resolution
   over a primary Transport Class fail.

   To accomplish this, the "Resolution Scheme" is configured with the
   primary Transport Class, and an ordered list of fallback Transport
   Classes.  Two Resolution Schemes are considered equivalent in Intent
   if they consist of the same ordered set of TRDBs.

   Operators take care that Resolution Schemes for a mapping community
   are configured consistently on various nodes participating in a BGP
   CT network, based on desired Intent and transport classes available
   in that domain.

5.1.  Mapping Community

   Mapping community is a "role" and not a new type of community; any
   BGP Community Like Attribute (e.g.  Community or Extended Community)
   may play this role.  Operator provisioning ensures that the ingress
   and egress SNs agree on the BGP CLA and community namespace to use as
   Mapping community.

   A Mapping Community maps to exactly one Resolution Scheme at
   receiving BGP speaker.  An implementation SHOULD allow associating
   multiple Mapping Communities to a Resolution Scheme.  This helps with
   renumbering and migration scenarios.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   An example of mapping community is "color:0:100", described in
   [RFC9012], or the "transport-target:0:100" described in Section 4.3
   in this document.

   The first community on an overlay route that matches a Mapping
   Community of a locally configured Resolution Scheme is considered the
   effective Mapping Community for the route.  The Resolution Scheme
   thus found is used when resolving the route's PNH.  If a route
   contains more than one Mapping Community, it indicates that the route
   considers these distinct Mapping Communities as equivalent in Intent.

   Overlay routes SHOULD NOT contain more than one Mapping Community.
   Conflicting multiple Mapping Communities may result in inconsistent
   route selection.

   If more than one distinct Mapping Communities on an overlay route map
   to multiple Resolution Schemes with dissimilar Intents at a receiving
   node, it is considered a configuration error.  Operators should avoid
   such configuration errors when attaching mapping community on overlay
   routes.

   It should be noted that the Mapping community role does not require
   applying RT-Constrain procedures specified in RFC 4684.

6.  BGP Classful Transport Family

   The BGP Classful Transport (BGP CT) family will use the existing
   Address Family Identifier (AFI) of IPv4 or IPv6 and a new SAFI 76
   "Classful Transport" that will applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 AFIs.

   The AFI/SAFI 1/76 MUST be negotiated as per the Multiprotocol
   Extensions capability described in Section 8 of [RFC4760] to be able
   to send and receive BGP CT routes for IPv4 endpoint prefixes.

   The AFI/SAFI 2/76 MUST be negotiated as per the Multiprotocol
   Extensions capability described in Section 8 of [RFC4760] to be able
   to send and receive BGP CT routes for IPv6 endpoint prefixes.

6.1.  NLRI Encoding

   The "Classful Transport" SAFI NLRI (AFI/SAFI 1/76 or 2/76) has same
   encoding as specified in Section 2 of [RFC8277].

   When AFI/SAFI is 1/76, the Classful Transport NLRI Prefix consists of
   an 8-byte RD followed by an IPv4 prefix.  When AFI/SAFI is 2/76, the
   Classful Transport NLRI Prefix consists of an 8-byte RD followed by
   an IPv6 prefix.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   The procedures described for AFI/SAFIs 1/4 or 1/128 in Section 2 of
   [RFC8277] apply for AFI/SAFI 1/76 also.  The procedures described for
   AFI/SAFIs 2/4 or 2/128 in Section 2 of [RFC8277] apply for AFI/SAFI
   2/76 also.

   BGP CT routes MAY carry multiple labels in the NLRI, by negotiating
   the Multiple Labels Capability as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8277]

   Attributes on a Classful Transport route include the Transport Class
   Route Target extended community, which is used to associate the route
   with the correct TRDBs on SNs and BNs in the network and either an
   IPv4 or an IPv6 next hop.

6.2.  Next Hop Encoding

   When the length of the Next hop Address field is 4, the next hop
   address is of type IPv4 address.

   When the length of Next hop Address field is 16 (or 32), the next hop
   address is of type IPv6 address (potentially followed by the link-
   local IPv6 address of the next hop).  This follows Section 3 in
   [RFC2545]

   When the length of Next hop Address field is 24 (or 48), the next hop
   address is of type VPN-IPv6 with an 8-octet RD set to zero
   (potentially followed by the link-local VPN-IPv6 address of the next
   hop with an 8-octet RD set to zero).  This follows Section 3.2.1.1 in
   [RFC4659]

   When the length of the Next hop Address field is 12, the next hop
   address is of type VPN-IPv4 with 8-octet RD set to zero.

   Any errors in length of the Next hop Address field is handled as per
   RFC 7606 Section 7.11.

6.3.  Carrying multiple Encapsulation Information

   To ease interoperability between nodes supporting different
   forwarding technologies, a BGP CT route allows carrying multiple
   encapsulation information.

   An MPLS Label is carried using the encoding in [RFC8277] . A node
   that does not support MPLS forwarding advertises the special label 3
   (Implicit NULL) in the RFC 8277 MPLS Label field.  The Implicit NULL
   label carried in BGP CT route indicates to receiving node that it
   should not impose any BGP CT label for this route.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   The SID information for SR with respect to MPLS Data Plane is carried
   as specified in Prefix SID attribute defined as part of Section 3 in
   [RFC8669].

   The SID information for SR with respect to SRv6 Data Plane is carried
   as specified in Section 7.13.

   UDP tunneling information is carried using Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute as specified in [RFC9012].

6.4.  Comparison with Other Families using RFC-8277 Encoding

   AFI/SAFI 1/128 (MPLS-labeled VPN address) is an RFC8277 encoded
   family that carries service prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes
   come from the customer namespaces and are contextualized into
   separate user virtual service RIBs called VRFs as per [RFC4364].

   AFI/SAFI 1/4 (BGP LU) is an RFC8277 encoded family that carries
   transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the
   provider namespace.

   AFI/SAFI 1/76 (Classful Transport SAFI) is an RFC8277 encoded family
   that carries transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come
   from the provider namespace and are contextualized into separate TRDB
   as per RFC4364 procedures.

   It is worth noting that AFI/SAFI 1/128 has been used to carry
   transport prefixes in "L3VPN Inter-AS Carrier's carrier" scenario as
   defined in Section 10 of [RFC4364], where BGP LU/LDP prefixes in CsC
   VRF are advertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 towards the remote-end client
   carrier.

   In this document, SAFI 76 (BGP CT) is used instead of reusing SAFI
   128 (L3VPN) for AFIs 1 or 2 to carry these transport routes because
   it is operationally advantageous to segregate transport and service
   prefixes into separate address families.  For e.g., such an approach
   allows operators to safely enable "per-prefix" label allocation
   scheme for Classful Transport prefixes, typically with a space
   complexity of O(1K) to O(100K), without affecting SAFI 128 service
   prefixes, with a space complexity of O(1M).  The "per prefix" label
   allocation scheme keeps the routing churn local during topology
   changes.

   Service routes continue to be carried in their existing AFI/SAFIs
   without any change, e.g., L3VPN (AFI/SAFI: 1/128 and 2/128), EVPN
   (AFI/SAFI: 25/70 ), VPLS (AFI/SAFI: 25/65), Internet (AFI/SAFI: 1/1
   or 2/1).  And resolve over BGP CT (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 and 2/76) transport
   routes.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   A new SAFI for AFI 1 and 2 also facilitates having a different
   readvertisement path of the transport family routes in a network than
   the service route readvertisement path.  Service routes (Inet-VPN
   SAFI 128) are exchanged over an EBGP multihop session between ASes
   with next hop unchanged; whereas Classful Transport routes (SAFI 76)
   are readvertised over EBGP single hop sessions with "next hop self"
   rewrite over inter-AS links.

   The BGP CT SAFI 76 for AFI 1 and 2 is similar in vein to BGP LU SAFI
   4, in that it carries transport prefixes.  The only difference is
   that it also carries in Route Target, an indication of which
   Transport Class the transport prefix belongs to and uses RD to
   disambiguate multiple instances of the same transport prefix in a BGP
   Update.

7.  Protocol Procedures

   This section summarizes the procedures followed by various nodes
   speaking Classful Transport family.

7.1.  Preparing the network to deploy Classful Transport planes

      It is responsibility of the operators to decide the Transport
      Classes to enable and use in their network.  They are also
      expected to allocate a Transport Class Route Target to identify
      each Transport Class.

      Operators configure the Transport Classes on the SNs and BNs in
      the network with Transport Class Route Targets and unique Route-
      Distinguishers.

      Implementations MAY provide automatic generation and assignment of
      RD, RT values; they MAY also provide a way to manually override
      the automatic mechanism in order to deal with any conflicts that
      may arise with existing RD, RT values in different network domains
      participating in the deployment.

7.2.  Originating Classful Transport Routes

      BGP CT routes are sent only to BGP peers that have negotiated the
      Multiprotocol Extensions capability described in Section 8 of
      [RFC4760] to be able to send and receive BGP CT routes.

      At the ingress node of the tunnel's home domain, the tunneling
      protocols install tunnel routes in the TRDB associated with the
      Transport Class to which the tunnel belongs.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


      The egress node of the tunnel i.e. the tunnel endpoint (EP)
      originates the BGP CT route with NLRI containing RD:EP, Transport
      Class RT and PNH as EP, which will be resolved over the tunnel
      route in TRDB at the ingress node.  When the tunnel is up, the
      Classful Transport BGP route will become usable and get re-
      advertised by the ingress node to BGP peers in neighboring
      domains.

      Alternatively, the ingress node of the tunnel, which is also an
      ASBR/ABR in tunnel's home domain, may originate the BGP CT route
      for the tunnel destination with NLRI RD:EP, attaching a Transport
      Class Route Target that identifies the Transport Class.  This BGP
      CT route is advertised to EBGP peers and IBGP peers in neighboring
      domains.

      This route SHOULD NOT be advertised to the IBGP core that contains
      the tunnel, using policy configuration.  Impact of not prohibiting
      such advertisements is outside the scope of this document.

      Unique RD SHOULD be used by the originator of a Classful Transport
      route to disambiguate the multiple BGP advertisements for a
      transport endpoint.  An administrator may use duplicate RDs based
      on local choice, understanding the impact on path diversity and
      troubleshooting, as described in Section 10.2.

7.3.  Processing Classful Transport Routes by Ingress Nodes

      Upon receipt of a BGP CT route (e.g., AFI/SAFI: 1/76, 2/76) with a
      PNH EP that is not directly connected (e.g. an IBGP-route), a
      Mapping Community on the route (the Transport Class RT) is used to
      decide to which resolution scheme this route is to be mapped.  The
      resolution scheme for a Transport Class RT with Transport Class ID
      "C1" contains TRDB for Transport Class with same ID.  In cases
      where Transport Class "C1" tunnels are not available in a domain,
      the administrator MAY customize the resolution scheme to map to a
      different set of transport classes available in that domain.

      The routes in the associated TRDBs are used to resolve the
      received PNH EP.  The order of TRDBs in a resolution scheme is
      followed when resolving the received PNH, such that a route in
      backup TRDB is used only when a matching route was not found for
      EP in the primary TRDBs preceding it.  This achieves the fallback
      desired by the resolution scheme.

      If the resolution process does not find a matching route for EP in
      any of the associated TRDBs, the received BGP CT route MUST be
      considered unresolvable.  (See RFC 4271, Section 9.1.2.1).




Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


      The received BGP CT route MUST be added to the TRDB corresponding
      to the Transport Class "C1".  RD is stripped by the ingress node
      from the BGP CT NLRI prefix RD:EP when a BGP CT route is added to
      a TRDB.  So that service routes can resolve over this BGP CT
      tunnel route for EP.  This step applies only if the Transport
      Class RT is received on a BGP route in address family with SAFI
      76.

7.4.  Readvertising Classful Transport Route by Border Nodes with Next
      Hop Self

      BNs allocate an MPLS label to advertise upstream in Classful
      Transport NLRI.  A BN also installs an MPLS route for that label
      that swaps the incoming label with a label received from the
      downstream BGP speaker or pops the incoming label.  It then pushes
      received traffic to the transport tunnel or direct interface that
      the Classful Transport route's PNH resolved over.

      The label SHOULD be allocated with "per-prefix" label allocation
      semantics.  The IP prefix in the TRDB context (Transport-Class,
      IP-prefix) is used as the key to do per-prefix label allocation.
      This helps in avoiding BGP CT route churn throughout the CT
      network when an instability (e.g. link failure) is experienced in
      a domain.  The failure is not propagated further than the BN
      closest to the failure.  If a different label allocation mode is
      used, impact on end to end convergence should be considered.

      The value of the advertised MPLS label is locally significant, and
      is dynamic by default.  A BN may provide an option to allocate a
      value from a statically carved out range.  This can be achieved
      using locally configured export policy, or via mechanisms such as
      the ones described in BGP Prefix-SID [RFC8669].

7.5.  Border Nodes Receiving Classful Transport Routes on EBGP

      If a route is received with PNH that is known to be directly
      connected (e.g.  EBGP single-hop neighbor address), the directly
      connected interface is checked for MPLS forwarding capability.  No
      other next hop resolution process is performed, as the inter-AS
      link can be used for any Transport Class.

      If the inter-AS links need to honor Transport Class, then the BN
      MUST follow procedures of an Ingress node described previously and
      perform next hop resolution process.  In order to make the link
      Transport Class aware, the route to directly connected PNH is
      installed in the TRDB belonging to the associated Transport Class.

7.6.  Avoiding Path Hiding Through Route Reflectors

      When multiple instances of a given RD:EP exist with different
      forwarding characteristics, then ADDPATH [RFC7911] is helpful.

      When multiple BNs exist such that they advertise a "RD:EP" prefix
      to Route Reflectors (RRs), the RRs may hide all but one of the
      BNs, unless ADDPATH [RFC7911] is used for the Classful Transport
      family.  This is similar to L3VPN Option B scenarios.

      Hence, ADDPATH [RFC7911] SHOULD be used for Classful Transport
      family, to avoid path-hiding through RRs.  Such that RR sends the
      multiple routes for RD:EP to it's clients.  This improves
      convergence time when path via one of the multiple BNs fails.

7.7.  Avoiding Loops Between Route Reflectors in Forwarding Path

      A pair of redundant ABRs, each acting as an RR with next hop self,
      may choose each other as best path instead of the upstream ASBR,
      causing a traffic forwarding loop.

      This happens because of following the path selection rule
      specified in Section 9 of BGP RR [RFC4456] that tie-breaks on
      ORIGINATOR_ID before CLUSTER_LIST.  RFC4456 considers pure RR
      functionality which is not in forwarding path.  When a RR is in
      forwarding path and reflects routes with next hop self, as is the
      case for ABR BNs in a BGP transport network, this rule may cause
      loops.

      This problem can happen for routes of any BGP address family,
      including BGP CT and BGP LU.

      Using one or more of the following approaches softens the
      possibility of such loops in a network with redundant ABRs.

7.7.1.  Path selection change

      Implementations SHOULD provide a way to alter the tie-breaking
      rule specified in Section 9 of BGP RR [RFC4456] so as to tie-break
      on CLUSTER_LIST step before ORIGINATOR_ID step, when performing
      path selection for BGP routes.

      This document suggests the following modification to the BGP
      Decision Process Tie Breaking rules (Section 9.1.2.2 of [RFC4271])
      that can be applied to path selection of BGP routes:






Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 23]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


      The following rule SHOULD be inserted between Steps e) and f): a
      BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter CLUSTER_LIST
      length.  The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route does not carry
      the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.

7.7.2.  Other mechanisms

      Taking into account some other deployment considerations can also
      help in avoiding this problem, e.g.,:

      -  IGP metric should be assigned such that "ABR to redundant ABR"
         cost is inferior to "ABR to upstream ASBR" cost.

      -  Tunnels belonging to non 'best effort' Transport Classes SHOULD
         NOT be provisioned between ABRs.  This will ensure that the BGP
         CT route received from an ABR with next hop self will not be
         usable at a redundant ABR.

7.8.  Ingress Nodes Receiving Service Routes with a Mapping Community

      Upon receipt of a BGP service route (e.g., AFI/SAFI: 1/1, 2/1)
      with a PNH EP that is not directly connected (e.g. an IBGP-route),
      a Mapping Community on the route (e.g, Color Extended Community)
      is used to decide to which resolution scheme this route is to be
      mapped.  The resolution scheme for a Color Extended Community with
      Color "C1" contains TRDB for Transport Class with same ID,
      followed by Best Effort TRDB.  The administrator MAY customize the
      resolution scheme to map to a different ordered list of TRDBs.

      The routes in the associated TRDBs are used to resolve the
      received PNH EP.  The order of TRDBs in a resolution scheme is
      followed when resolving the received PNH, such that a route in
      backup TRDB is used only when a matching route was not found for
      EP in the primary TRDBs preceding it.  This achieves the fallback
      desired by the resolution scheme.

      If the resolution process does not find a Tunnel Route for EP in
      any of the Transport Route Databases, the service route MUST be
      considered unresolvable.  (See RFC 4271, Section 9.1.2.1).

   Note: For an illustration of above procedures in a MPLS network,
   refer to Section 8.

7.9.  Best Effort Transport Class

      It is possible to represent 'Best effort' SLA also as a Transport
      Class.  Today, BGP LU (e.g.  AFI/SAFI 1/4) is used to extend the
      best effort intra domain tunnels to other domains.



Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


      Alternatively, BGP CT (e.g.  AFI/SAFI 1/76) may be used to carry
      the best effort tunnels also.  This document reserves the
      Transport Class ID value 0 to represent "Best Effort Transport
      Class ID".  However, implementations SHOULD provide configuration
      to use a different value for this purpose.  Procedures to manage
      differences in Transport Class ID namespaces between domains are
      provided in Section 11.2.2.

      The 'Best Effort Transport Class ID' value is used in the
      'Transport Class ID' field of Transport Route Target Extended
      Community that is attached to the BGP CT route that advertises a
      best effort tunnel endpoint.  The RT thus formed is called the
      "Best Effort Transport Class Route Target".

      When a BN or SN receives a BGP CT route with Best Effort Transport
      Class Route Target as the mapping community, the Best effort
      resolution scheme is used for resolving the BGP next hop, and the
      resultant route is installed in the best effort transport route
      database.  If no best effort tunnel was found to resolve the BGP
      next hop, the BGP CT route MUST be considered unusable, and not be
      propagated further.

      When a BGP speaker receives an overlay route without any explicit
      Mapping Community, and absent local policy, the best effort
      resolution scheme is used for resolving the BGP next hop on the
      route.  This behavior is backward compatible to behavior of an
      implementation that does not follow procedures described in this
      document.

      Implementations MAY provide configuration to selectively install
      BGP CT routes to the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), to provide
      reachability for control plane peering towards endpoints in other
      domains.

7.10.  Interaction with BGP Attributes Specifying Next Hop Address and
       Color

   The Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute, described in [RFC9012] can be
   used to request a specific type of tunnel encapsulation.  This
   attribute may apply to BGP service routes or transport routes,
   including BGP Classful Transport family routes.

   The mechanisms described in BGP MultiNexthop Attribute [MNH] allow a
   BGP route to carry multiple next hop addresses.  Specifying
   'Transport Class ID' as a qualifier for each next hop address is also
   allowed.





Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   It should be noted that in such cases "Transport Class ID/Color" can
   exist in multiple places on the same route, and a precedence order
   needs to be established to determine which Transport Class the
   route's next hop should resolve over.  This document suggests the
   following order of precedence, more specific scoping of Color
   preferred to less specific scoping:

      Transport Class ID SubTLV, in MultiNexthop Attribute.

      Color SubTLV, in Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute.

      Transport Target Extended community, on BGP CT route.

      Color Extended community, on BGP service route.

   Transport Class ID specified for Nexthop-Leg subTLV in a MultiNextHop
   attribute is a more specific indication of Color than Color subTLV in
   a TEA, which in turn is more specific than Mapping Community
   (Transport Target) on a BGP CT transport route, which is in turn more
   specific than a Service route scoped Mapping Community (Color
   Extended community).

7.11.  Applicability to Flowspec Redirect to IP

   Flowspec routes using Redirect to IP next hop is described in
   [FLOWSPEC-REDIR-IP]

   Such Flowspec BGP routes with Redirect to IP next hop MAY be attached
   with a Mapping Community (e.g.  Color:0:100), which allows
   redirecting the flow traffic over a tunnel to the IP next hop
   satisfying the desired SLA (e.g.  Transport Class color 100).

   Flowspec BGP family acts as just another service that can make use of
   BGP CT architecture to achieve Flow based forwarding with SLAs.

7.12.  Applicability to IPv6

   This section describes applicability of BGP CT to IPv6 at various
   layers.  BGP CT procedures apply equally to an IPv6 enabled Intra-AS
   or Inter-AS Option A, B, C network.

   A BGP CT enabled network supports IPv6 service families (e.g., AFI/
   SAFI 2/1 or 2/128) and IPv6 transport signaling protocols like
   SRTEv6, LDPv6, RSVP-TEv6.

   Procedures in this document also apply to a network with Pure IPv6
   core, that uses MPLS forwarding for intra-domain tunnels and inter-AS
   links.  BGP CTv6 family (AFI/SAFI: 2/76) is used to carry global IPv6



Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 26]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   address tunnel endpoints in the NLRI.  Service family routes (e.g.
   AFI/SAFI: 1/1, 2/1, 1/128, 2/128) are also advertised with those
   Global IPv6 addresses as next hop.

   Procedures in this document also apply to a 6PE network with an IPv4
   core, that uses MPLS forwarding for intra-domain tunnels and Inter-AS
   links.  BGP CTv6 family (AFI/SAFI: 2/76) is used to carry IPv4 Mapped
   IPv6 address tunnel endpoints in the NLRI.  IPv6 Service family
   routes (e.g., AFI/SAFI: 2/1, 2/128) are also advertised with those
   IPv4 Mapped IPv6 addresses as next hop.

   The PE-CE attachment circuits may use IPv4 addresses only, IPv6
   addresses only, or both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.


7.13.  SRv6 Support

   This section describes how BGP CT family (e.g.  AFI/SAFI 2/76) may be
   used to set up inter-domain tunnels of a certain Transport Class,
   when using Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) data plane on the inter-
   AS links or as an intra-AS tunneling mechanism.

   The BGP CT route update for SRv6 MUST include an attribute containing
   SRv6 SID information, with Transposition scheme disabled.

   This may be the BGP Prefix-SID attribute as specified in [RFC9252]
   containing a "SRv6 SID Information Sub-TLV".  If the Prefix-SID
   attribute also contains a "SRv6 SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV", the
   Transposition Length is set to 0 and Transposition Offset is set to
   0.  This indicates nothing is transposed and that the entire SRv6 SID
   value is encoded in the "SRv6 SID Information Sub-TLV".

   It should be noted that prefixes carried in BGP CT family are
   transport layer end-points, e.g.  PE loopback addresses.  Thus, the
   SRv6 SID carried in a BGP CT route is also a transport layer
   identifier.

   Details of SRv6 Endpoint behaviors used by BGP CT and the procedures
   are specified in a separate document [BGP-CT-SRv6], along with
   illustration.

7.14.  Error Handling Considerations

   If a BGP speaker receives both Transitive (Section 13.2.1.1.1) and
   Non-Transitive (Section 13.2.1.1.2) versions of Transport Class
   extended community on a route, only the Transitive one is used.





Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 27]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   If a BGP speaker considers a received "Transport Class" extended
   community (Transitive or Non-Transitive version), or any other part
   of a BGP CT route invalid for some reason, but is able to
   successfully parse the NLRI and attributes, Treat-as-withdraw
   approach from [RFC7606] is used.  The route is kept as Unusable, with
   appropriate diagnostic information, to aid troubleshooting.

8.  Illustration of BGP CT Procedures

   This section illustrates BGP CT procedures in an Inter AS Option C
   MPLS network.

   All Illustrations in this document make use of [RFC6890] IP address
   ranges.  The range 192.0.2.0/24 is used to represent transport
   endpoints like loopback addresses.  The range 203.0.113.0/24 is used
   to represent service route prefixes advertised in AFI/SAFIs: 1/1 or
   1/128.

   This example shows a provider MPLS network that consists of two ASes,

   Traffic direction being described is CE41 to CE31.  CE31 may request
   a specific SLA (e.g. mapped to Gold for this example), when
   traversing these provider networks.

   AS2 is further divided into two regions.  So, there are three tunnel
   domains in provider's space.  AS1 uses ISIS Flex-Algo [RFC9350]
   intra-domain tunnels, whereas AS2 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels.
   MPLS forwarding is used within these domains and on inter-domain
   links.

   The network exposes two Transport Classes: "Gold" with Transport
   Class id 100, "Bronze" with Transport Class id 200.  These Transport
   Classes are provisioned at the PEs and the Border nodes (ABRs, ASBRs)
   in the network.

   Following tunnels exist for Gold Transport Class.

      PE25_to_ABR23_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE25_to_ABR24_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR13_to_PE11_gold - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR14_to_PE11_gold - SRTE tunnel

   Following tunnels exist for Bronze Transport Class.

      PE25_to_ABR23_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR23_to_ASBR21_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR23_to_ASBR22_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ABR24_to_ASBR21_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR13_to_PE12_bronze - ISIS FlexAlgo tunnel

      ASBR14_to_PE11_bronze - ISIS FlexAlgo tunnel

   These tunnels are either provisioned or auto-discovered to belong to
   Transport Classes 100 or 200.

8.2.  Service Layer Route Exchange

   Service nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate service families (AFI: 1 and SAFIs
   1, 128) on the BGP session with RR16.  Service helpers RR16 and RR26
   exchange these service routes with next hop unchanged over a multihop
   EBGP session between the two AS.  PE25 negotiates service families
   (AFI: 1 and SAFIs 1, 128) with RR26.




Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   The PEs see each other as next hop in the BGP Update for the service
   family routes.  Addpath send, receive is enabled on both directions
   on the EBGP multihop session between RR16 and RR26 for AFI:1 and
   SAFIs 1, 128.  Addpath send is negotiated in the RR to PE direction
   in each AS.  This is to avoid path hiding of service routes at RR.
   E.g.  AFI/SAFI 1/1 routes advertised by both PE11 and PE12.  Or, AFI/
   SAFI 1/128 routes originated by both PE11 and PE12 using same RD.

   Forwarding happens using service routes installed at service nodes
   PE25, PE11, PE12 only.  Service routes received from CEs are not
   present in any other nodes' FIB in the network.

   As an example, CE31 advertises a route for prefix 203.0.113.31 with
   next hop as self to PE11, PE12.  CE31 can attach a Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 on this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA.  Or,
   PE11 can attach the same using locally configured policies.

   Consider, CE31 is getting VPN service from PE11.  The
   RD1:203.0.113.31 route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE11 with
   next hop self (192.0.2.11) and label V-L1, to RR16 with the Mapping
   Community Color:0:100 attached.  RR16 advertises this route with
   Addpath-ID to RR26 which readvertises to PE25 with next hop
   unchanged.  Now, PE25 can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.11 using transport
   routes received in BGP CT or BGP LU.

   Using Addpath, service routes advertised by PE11 and PE12 for AFI:1
   SAFIs 1, 128 reach PE25 via RR16, RR26 with the next hop unchanged,
   as PE11 or PE12.

   The IP FIB at PE25 VRF will have a route for 203.0.113.31 with a next
   hop when resolved, that points to a Gold tunnel in ingress domain.

8.3.  Transport Layer Route Propagation

   Egress nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate BGP CT family with transport ASBRs
   ASBR13, ASBR14.  These egress nodes originate BGP CT routes for
   tunnel endpoint addresses, that are advertised as next hop in BGP
   service routes.  In this example, both PEs participate in transport
   classes Gold and Bronze.  The protocol procedures are explained using
   the Gold SLA transport plane and the Bronze SLA transport plane is
   used to highlight the path hiding aspects.

   PE11 is provisioned with transport class 100, RD value 192.0.2.11:100
   and a transport-target:0:100 for Gold tunnels.  And a Transport class
   200 with RD value 192.0.2.11:200, and transport route target 0:200
   for Bronze tunnels.  Similarly, PE12 is provisioned with transport
   class 100, RD value 192.0.2.12:100 and a transport-target:0:100 for
   Gold tunnels.  And transport class 200, RD value 192.0.2.12:200 with

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   transport-target:0:200 for Bronze tunnels.  Note that in this
   example, the BGP CT routes carry only the transport class route
   target, and no IP address format route target.

   The RD value originated by an egress node is not modified by any BGP
   speakers when the route is readvertised to the ingress node.  Thus,
   the RD can be used to identify the originator (unique RD provisioned)
   or set of originators (RD reused on multiple nodes).

   Similarly, these transport classes are also configured on ASBRs, ABRs
   and PEs with same Transport Route Target and unique RDs.

   ASBR13 and ASBR14 negotiate BGP CT family with transport ASBRs
   ASBR21, ASBR22 in neighboring AS.  They negotiate BGP CT family with
   RR27 in region 2, which reflects BGP CT routes to ABR23, ABR24.
   ABR23, ABR24 negotiate BGP CT family with Ingress node PE25 in region
   1.  BGP LU family is also negotiated on these sessions alongside BGP
   CT family.  BGP LU carries "best effort" transport class routes, BGP
   CT carries Gold, Bronze transport class routes.

   PE11 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with Gold SLA to
   endpoint PE11.  This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix
   192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11, Label B-L0, next hop 192.0.2.11 and a
   route target extended community transport-target:0:100.  Label B-L0
   can either be Implicit Null (Label 3) or an Ultimate Hop Pop (UHP)
   label.

   This route is received by ASBR13 and it resolves over the tunnel
   ASBR13_to_PE11_gold.  The route is then readvertised by ASBR13 in BGP
   CT family to ASBRs ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy.  This
   route is sent with same NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11,
   Label B-L1, next hop self, and transport-target:0:100.  MPLS swap
   route is installed at ASBR13 for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to
   ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel.

   Similarly, ASBR14 also receives a BGP CT route for
   192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 from PE11 and it resolves over the tunnel
   ASBR14_to_PE11_gold.  The route is then readvertised by ASBR14 in BGP
   CT family to ASBRs ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy.  This
   route is sent with the same NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11,
   Label B-L2, next hop self, and transport-target:0:100.  MPLS swap
   route is installed at ASBR14 for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to
   ASBR14_to_PE11_gold tunnel.

   In the Bronze plane, BGP CT route with Bronze SLA to endpoint PE11 is
   originated by PE11 with a NLRI containing RD prefix
   192.0.2.11:200:192.0.2.11, and appropriate label.  The RD allows both
   Gold and Bronze advertisements to traverse path selection pinchpoints

   without any path hiding at RRs or ASBRs.  And route target extended
   community transport-target:0:200 lets the route resolve over Bronze
   tunnels in the network, similar to the process being described for
   Gold SLA path.

   Moving back to the Gold plane, ASBR21 receives the Gold SLA BGP CT
   routes for NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 over the single
   hop EBGP sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and can compute ECMP/FRR
   towards them.  ASBR21 readvertises BGP CT route for
   192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 with next hop self (loopback address
   192.0.2.21) to RR27, advertising a new label B-L3.  An MPLS swap
   route is installed for label B-L3 at ASBR21 to swap to received label
   B-L1, B-L2 and forward to ASBR13, ASBR14 respectively.  RR27
   readvertises this BGP CT route to ABR23, ABR24 with label and next
   hop unchanged.

   Similarly, ASBR22 receives BGP CT route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
   over the single hop EBGP sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and
   readvertises with next hop self (loopback address 192.0.2.22) to
   RR27, advertising a new label B-L4.  An MPLS swap route is installed
   for label B-L4 at ASBR22 to swap to received label B-L1, B-L2 and
   forward to ASBR13, ASBR14 respectively.  RR27 readvertises this BGP
   CT route also to ABR23, ABR24 with label and next hop unchanged.

   Addpath is enabled for BGP CT family on the sessions between RR27 and
   ASBRs, ABRs such that routes for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 with the
   next hops ASBR21 and ASBR22 are reflected to ABR23, ABR24 without any
   path hiding.  Thus, ABR23 is given visibility of both available next
   hops for Gold SLA.

   ABR23 receives the route with next hop 192.0.2.21, label B-L3 from
   RR27.  The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route acts
   as Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the
   next hop using transport class 100 routes only.  ABR23 is unable to
   find a route for 192.0.2.21 with transport class 100.  Thus, it
   considers this route unusable and does not propagate it further.
   This prunes ASBR21 from Gold SLA tunneled path.

   ABR23 also receives the route with next hop 192.0.2.22, label B-L4
   from RR27.  The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route
   acts as Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve
   the next hop using transport class 100 routes only.  ABR23
   successfully resolves the next hop to point to ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold
   tunnel.  ABR23 readvertises this BGP CT route with next hop self
   (loopback address 192.0.2.23) and a new label B-L5 to PE25.  Swap
   route for B-L5 is installed by ABR23 to swap to label B-L4, and
   forward into ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   PE25 receives the BGP CT route for prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
   with label B-L5, next hop 192.0.2.23 and transport-target:0:100 from
   RR26.  And it similarly resolves the next hop 192.0.2.23 over
   transport class 100, pushing labels associated with
   PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.

   In this manner, the Gold transport LSP "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" in the
   egress domain is extended by BGP CT until the ingress node PE25 in
   the ingress domain, to create an end-to-end Gold SLA path.  MPLS swap
   routes are installed at ASBR13, ASBR22 and ABR23, when propagating
   the PE11 BGP CT Gold transport class route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
   with next hop self towards PE25.

   The BGP CT LSP thus formed, originates in PE25, and terminates in
   ASBR13 (assuming PE11 advertised Implicit Null), traversing over the
   Gold underlay LSPs in each domain.  ASBR13 uses UHP to stitch the BGP
   CT LSP into the "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" LSP to traverse the last
   domain, thus satisfying Gold SLA end-to-end.

   When PE25 receives service routes from RR26 with next hop 192.0.2.11
   and mapping community Color:0:100, it resolves over this BGP CT route
   192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11.  Thus, pushing label B-L5, and pushing as
   top label the labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.

8.4.  Data Plane View

8.4.1.  Steady State

   This section describes how the data plane looks in steady state.

   CE41 transmits an IP packet with destination as 203.0.113.31.  On
   receiving this packet, PE25 performs a lookup in the IP FIB
   associated with the CE41 interface.  This lookup yields the service
   route that pushes the VPN service label V-L1, BGP CT label B-L5, and
   labels for PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.  Thus, PE25 encapsulates the IP
   packet in an MPLS packet with label V-L1(innermost), B-L5, and top
   label as PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.  This MPLS packet is thus
   transmitted to ABR23 using Gold SLA.

   ABR23 decapsulates the packet received on PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel
   as required, and finds the MPLS packet with label B-L5.  It performs
   a lookup for label B-L5 in the global MPLS FIB.  This yields the
   route that swaps label B-L5 with label B-L4, and pushes the top label
   provided by ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.  Thus, ABR23 transmits the
   MPLS packet with label B-L4 to ASBR22, on a tunnel that satisfies
   Gold SLA.





Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 33]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   ASBR22 similarly performs a lookup for label B-L4 in global MPLS FIB,
   finds the route that swaps label B-L4 with label B-L2, and forwards
   to ASBR13 over the directly connected MPLS-enabled interface.  This
   interface is a common resource not dedicated to any specific
   transport class, in this example.

   ASBR13 receives the MPLS packet with label B-L2, and performs a
   lookup in MPLS FIB, finds the route that pops label B-L2, and pushes
   labels associated with ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel.  This transmits
   the MPLS packet with VPN label V-L1 to PE11 using a tunnel that
   preserves Gold SLA in AS 1.

   PE11 receives the MPLS packet with V-L1, and performs VPN forwarding.
   Thus transmitting the original IP payload from CE41 to CE31.  The
   payload has traversed path satisfying Gold SLA end-to-end.

8.4.2.  Local Repair of Primary Path

   This section describes how the data plane at ASBR22 reacts when the
   link between ASBR22 and ASBR13 experiences a failure, and an
   alternate path exists.

   Assuming ASBR22_to_ASBR13 link goes down, such that traffic with Gold
   SLA going to PE11 needs repair.  ASBR22 has an alternate BGP CT route
   for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 from ASBR14.  This has been
   preprogrammed in forwarding by ASBR22 as FRR backup next hop for
   label B-L4.  This allows the Gold SLA traffic to be locally repaired
   at ASBR22 without the failure event propagated in the BGP CT network.
   In this case, ingress node PE25 will not know there was a failure,
   and traffic restoration will be independent of prefix scale (PIC).

8.4.3.  Absorbing Failure of Primary Path: Fallback to Best Effort
        Tunnels

   This section describes how the data plane reacts when a Gold path
   experiences a failure, but no alternate path exists.

   Assume tunnel ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold goes down, such that now no end-
   to-end Gold path exists in the network.  This makes the BGP CT route
   for RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 is unusable at ABR23.  This
   makes ABR23 send a BGP withdrawal for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 to
   PE25.

   The withdrawal for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 allows PE25 to react to
   the loss of the Gold path to 192.0.2.11.  Assuming PE25 is
   provisioned to use best effort transport class as the backup path,
   this withdrawal of BGP CT route allows PE25 to adjust the next hop of
   the VPN Service-route to push the labels provided by the BGP LU

   route.  That repairs the traffic to go via the best effort path.
   PE25 can also be provisioned to use Bronze transport class as the
   backup path.  The repair will happen in similar manner in that case
   as-well.

   Traffic repair to absorb the failure happens at ingress node PE25, in
   a service prefix scale independent manner.  This is called PIC
   (Prefix scale Independent Convergence).  The repair time will be
   proportional to time taken for withdrawing the BGP CT route.

   These examples demonstrate the various levels of failsafe mechanisms
   available to protect traffic in a BGP CT network.

9.  Scaling Considerations

9.1.  Avoiding Unintended Spread of BGP CT Routes Across Domains

      [RFC8212] suggests BGP speakers require explicit configuration of
      both BGP Import and Export Policies in order to receive or send
      routes over EBGP sessions.

      It is recommended to follow this for BGP CT routes.  It will
      prohibit unintended advertisement of transport routes throughout
      the BGP CT transport domain, which may span across multiple AS
      domains.  This will conserve usage of MPLS label and next hop
      resources in the network.  An ASBR of a domain can be provisioned
      to allow routes with only the Transport Route Targets that are
      required by SNs in the domain.

9.2.  Constrained Distribution of PNHs to SNs (On-Demand Next Hop)

      This section describes how the number of Protocol Next hops
      advertised to a SN or BN can be constrained using BGP Classful
      Transport and Route Target Constrain (RTC) [RFC4684].

      An egress SN MAY advertise a BGP CT route for RD:eSN with two
      Route Targets: transport-target:0:<TC> and a RT carrying
      <eSN>:<TC>, where TC is the Transport Class identifier, and eSN is
      the IP address used by SN as BGP next hop in its service route
      advertisements.











Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 35]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


      Note that such use of the IP address specific route target
      <eSN>:<TC> is optional in a BGP CT network.  It is required only
      if there is a requirement to prune the propagation of the
      transport route for an egress node eSN to only the set of ingress
      nodes that need it.  When only RT of transport-target:0:<TC> is
      used, the pruning happens in granularity of Transport Class ID
      (Color), and not BGP next hop; BGP CT routes will not be
      advertised into domains with PEs that don't import its transport
      class.

      The transport-target:0:<TC> is the new type of route target
      (Transport Class RT) defined in this document.  It is carried in
      BGP extended community attribute (BGP attribute code 16).

      The RT carrying <eSN>:<TC> MAY be an IP-address specific regular
      RT (BGP attribute code 16), IPv6-address specific RT (BGP
      attribute code 25).  It should be noted that the Local
      Administrator field of these RTs can only carry two octets of
      information, and thus the <TC> field in this approach is limited
      to a 2 octets value.  Future protocol extensions work is needed to
      define a BGP CLA that can accomodate an IPv4/IPv6 address along
      with a 4 octet Local Administrator field.

      An ingress SN MAY import BGP CT routes with Route Target carrying
      <eSN>:<TC>.  The ingress SN may learn the eSN values either by
      configuration, or it may discover them from the BGP next hop field
      in the BGP VPN service routes received from eSN.  A BGP ingress SN
      receiving a BGP service route with next hop of eSN generates a
      RTC/Extended-RTC route for Route Target prefix <Origin
      ASN>:<eSN>/[80|176] in order to learn BGP CT transport routes to
      reach eSN.  This allows constrained distribution of the transport
      routes to the PNHs actually required by iSN.

      When the path of route propagation of BGP CT routes is the same as
      the RTC routes, a BN would learn the RTC routes advertised by
      ingress SNs and propagate further.  This will allow constraining
      distribution of BGP CT routes for a PNH to only the necessary BNs
      in the network, closer to the egress SN.

      This mechanism provides "On Demand Next hop" of BGP CT routes,
      which help with the scaling of MPLS forwarding state at SN and BN.

      However, the amount of state carried in RTC family may become
      proportional to the number of PNHs in the network.  To strike a
      balance, the RTC route advertisements for <Origin
      ASN>:<eSN>/[80|176] MAY be confined to the BNs in the home region
      of an ingress SN, or the BNs of a super core.




Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 36]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


      Such a BN in the core of the network imports BGP CT routes with
      Transport-Target:0:<TC> and generates an RTC route for <Origin
      ASN>:0:<TC>/96, while not propagating the more specific RTC
      requests for specific PNHs.  This lets the BN learn transport
      routes to all eSN nodes but confine their propagation to ingress
      SNs.

9.3.  Limiting The Visibility Scope of PE Loopback as PNHs

      It may be even more desirable to limit the number of PNHs that are
      globally visible in the network.  This is possible using mechanism
      described in Appendix D

      Such that advertisement of PE loopback addresses as next-hop in
      BGP service routes is confined to the region they belong to.  An
      anycast IP-address called "Context Protocol Nexthop Address"
      (CPNH) abstracts the SNs in a region from other regions in the
      network.

      This provides much greater advantage in terms of scaling,
      convergence and security.  Changes to implement this feature are
      required only on the local region's BNs and RRs, so legacy PE
      devices can also benefit from this approach.

10.  Operations and Manageability Considerations

10.1.  MPLS OAM

   MPLS OAM procedures specified in [RFC8029] also apply to BGP Classful
   Transport.

   The 'Target FEC Stack' sub-TLV for IPv4 Classful Transport has a Sub-
   Type of 31744, and a length of 13.  The Value field consists of the
   RD advertised with the Classful Transport prefix, the IPv4 prefix
   (with trailing 0 bits to make 32 bits in all) and a prefix length
   encoded as shown in Figure 4.

10.2.  Usage of Route Distinguisher and Label Allocation Modes

   RDs aid in troubleshooting provider networks that deploy BGP CT, by
   uniquely identifying the originator of a route across an
   administrative domain that may either span multiple domains within a
   provider network or span closely coordinated provider networks.

   The use of RDs also provides an option for signaling forwarding
   diversity within the same Transport Class.  An SN can advertise an EP
   with the same Transport Class in multiple BGP CT routes with unique
   RDs.

   For e.g., unique "RDx:EP1" prefixes can be advertised by an SN for an
   EP1 to different upstream BNs with unique forwarding specific
   encapsulation (e.g., Label), in order to collect traffic statistics
   at the SN for each BN.  In absence of RD, duplicated Transport Class/
   Color values will be needed in the transport network to achieve such
   use cases.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   The allocation of RDs is done at the point of origin of the BGP CT
   route.  This can either be an Egress SN or a BN.  The default RD
   allocation mode is to use a unique RD per originating node for an EP.
   This mode allows for the ingress to uniquely identify each originated
   path.  Alternatively, the same RD may be provisioned for multiple
   originators of the same EP.  This mode can be used when the ingress
   does not require full visibility of all nodes originating an EP.

   A label is allocated for a BGP CT route when it is advertised with
   next hop self by a SN or a BN.  An implementation may use different
   label allocation modes with BGP CT.  The recommended label allocation
   mode is per-prefix as it provides better traffic convergence
   properties than per-next hop label allocation mode.  Furthermore, BGP
   CT offers two flavors for per-prefix label allocation.  The first
   flavor assigns a label for each unique "RD, EP".  The second flavor
   assigns a label for each unique "Transport Class, EP" while ignoring
   the RD.

   In a BGP CT network, the number of routes at an Ingress PE is a
   function of unique EPs multiplied by BNs in the ingress domain that
   do next hop self.  BGP CT provides flexible RD and Label allocation
   modes to address operational requirements in a multi-domain network.
   The impacts on the control plane and forwarding behavior for these
   modes are detailed with an example in Managing Transport Route
   Visibility (Section 10.3)

10.3.  Managing Transport Route Visibility

   This section details the usage of BGP CT RD and label allocation
   modes to calibrate the level of path visibility and the amount of
   route and label scale in a multi-domain network.

   Consider a multi-domain BGP CT network as illustrated in the
   following Figure 6:

            Figure 7: Route and Path Visibility at Ingress Node

   In the table shown in Figure 7, route scale at ingress node PE31 is
   proportional to path diversity in ingress domain (number of ASBRs)
   and point of origination of BGP CT route.  TE granularity at ingress
   node PE31 is proportional to the number of unique CT labels received,
   which depends on PP-mode and the path diversity in ingress domain.

   Deploying unique RDs is strongly RECOMMENDED because it helps in
   troubleshooting by uniquely identifying the originator of a route and
   avoids path-hiding.

   In typical deployments originating BGP CT routes at the egress node
   (SN) is recommended.  In this model, using either "RD, EP" or "TC,
   EP" Per-Prefix label allocation mode repairs traffic locally at the
   nearest BN for any failures in the network, because the label value
   does not change.

   Originating at BNs with unique RDs induces more routes than when
   originating at egress SNs.  In this model, use of "TC, EP" Per-Prefix
   label allocation mode repairs traffic locally at the nearest BN for
   any failures in the network, because the label value does not change.

   The previous table in Figure 7 demonstrates that BGP CT allows an
   operator to control how much path visibility and forwarding diversity
   is desired in the network, for both Unicast and Anycast endpoints.

11.  Deployment Considerations.

11.1.  Coordination Between Domains Using Different Community Namespaces

   Cooperating Inter-AS Option C domains may sometimes not agree on RT,
   RD, Mapping community or Transport Route Target values because of
   differences in community namespaces (e.g. during network mergers or
   renumbering for expansion).  Such deployments may deploy mechanisms
   to map and rewrite the Route Target values on domain boundaries,
   using per ASBR import policies.  This is no different than any other
   BGP VPN family.  Mechanisms used in inter-AS VPN deployments may be
   leveraged with the Classful Transport family also.

   A resolution scheme allows association with multiple Mapping
   Communities.  This minimizes service disruption during renumbering,
   network merger or transition scenarios.

   The Transport Class Route Target Extended Community is useful to
   avoid collision with regular Route Target namespace used by service
   routes.

11.2.  Managing Intent at Service and Transport layers.

   Illustration of BGP CT Procedures (Section 8) shows multiple domains
   that agree on a color name space (Agreeing Color Domains) and contain
   tunnels with equivalent set of colors (Homogenous Color Domains).

   However, in the real world, this may not always be guaranteed.  Two
   domains may independently manage their color namespaces; these are
   known as Non-Agreeing Color Domains.  Two domains may have tunnels
   with unequal set of colors; these are known as Heterogeneous Color
   Domains.

   This section describes how BGP CT is deployed in such scenarios to
   preserve end-to-end Intent.  Examples described in this section use
   Inter-AS Option C domains.  But similar mechanisms will work for
   Inter-AS Option A and Inter-AS Option B scenarios as well.

11.2.1.  Service Layer Color Management

   At the service layer, it is recommended that a global color namespace
   be maintained across multiple co-operating domains.  BGP CT allows
   indirection using resolution schemes to be able to maintain a global
   namespace in the service layer.  This is possible even if each domain
   independently maintains its own local transport color namespace.

   As explained in Next Hop Resolution Scheme (Section 5) , a mapping
   community carried on a service route maps to a resolution scheme.
   The mapping community values for the service route can be abstract
   and are not required to match the transport color namespace.  This
   abstract mapping community value representing a global service layer
   intent is mapped to a local transport layer intent available in each
   domain.

   In this manner, it is recommended to keep color namespace management
   at the service layer and the transport layer decoupled from each
   other.  In the following sections the service layer agrees on a
   single global namespace.

11.2.2.  Non-Agreeing Color Transport Domains

   Non-agreeing color domains require a mapping community rewrite on
   each domain boundary.  This rewrite helps to map one domain's
   namespace to another.

   The following example illustrates how traffic is stitched and SLA is
   preserved when domains don't use the same namespace at the transport
   layer.  Each domain specifies the same SLA using different color
   values.

        Figure 8: Transport Layer with Non-agreeing Color Domains

   In the topology shown in Figure 8, we have three Autonomous Systems.
   All the nodes in the topology support BGP CT.

   In AS1 Gold SLA is represented by color 100 and Bronze by 200.

   In AS2 Gold SLA is represented by color 300 and Bronze by 400.

   In AS3 Gold SLA is represented by color 500 and Bronze by 600.

   Though the color values are different, they map to tunnels with
   sufficiently similar TE characteristics in each domain.

   The service route carries an abstract mapping community that maps to
   the required SLA.  For example, Service routes that need to resolve
   over Gold transport tunnels, carry a mapping community
   color:0:100500.  In AS3 it maps to a resolution scheme containing
   TRDB with color 500 whereas in AS2 it maps to a TRDB with color 300
   and in AS1 it maps to a TRDB with color 100.  Co-ordination is needed
   to provision the resolution schemes in each domain as explained
   previously.

   At the AS boundary, the transport-class route-target is rewritten for
   the BGP CT routes.  In the previous topology, at ASBR31, the
   transport-target:0:500 for Gold tunnels is rewritten to transport-
   target:0:300 and then advertised to ASBR22.  Similarly, the
   transport-target:0:300 for Gold tunnels are re-written to transport-
   target:0:100 at ASBR21 before advertising to ASBR11.  At PE11, the
   transport route received with transport-target:0:100 will be added to
   the color 100 TRDB.  The service route received with mapping
   community color:0:100500 at PE1 maps to the Gold TRDB and resolves
   over this transport route.

   Inter-domain traffic forwarding in the previous topology works as
   explained in Section 8.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   Transport-target re-write requires co-ordination of color values
   between domains in the transport layer.  This method avoids the need
   to re-write service route mapping communities, keeping the service
   layer homogenous and simple to manage.  Coordinating Transport Class
   RT between two adjacent domains at a time is easier than coordinating
   service layer colors deployed in a global mesh of non-adjacent
   domains.  This basically allows localizing the problem to a pair of
   adjacent domains and solving it.

11.2.3.  Heterogeneous Agreeing Color Transport Domains

   In a heterogeneous domains scenario, it might not be possible to map
   a service layer intent to the matching transport color, as the color
   might not be locally available in a domain.

   The following example illustrates how traffic is stitched, when a
   transit AS contains more shades for an SLA path compared to Ingress
   and Egress domains.  This example shows how service routes can
   traverse through finer shades when available and take coarse shades
   otherwise.

   In AS2 Gold has finer shades: Gold1 by color 101 and Gold2 by color
   102.

   In AS3 Gold SLA is represented by color 100.

   This problem can be solved by the two following approaches:

11.2.3.1.  Duplicate Tunnels Approach

   In this approach, duplicate tunnels that satisfy Gold SLA are
   configured in domains AS1 and AS3, but they are given fine grained
   colors 101, 102.

   These tunnels will be installed in TRDBs corresponding to transport
   classes of color 101, 102.

   Overlay routes received with mapping community (e.g.: transport-
   target or color community) can resolve over these tunnels in the TRDB
   with matching color by using resolution schemes.

   This approach consumes more resources in the transport and forwarding
   layer, because of the duplicate tunnels.

11.2.3.2.  Customized Resolution Schemes Approach

   In this approach, resolution schemes in domains AS1 and AS3 are
   customized to map the received mapping community (e.g., transport-
   target or color community) over available Gold SLA tunnels.  This
   conserves resource usage with no additional state in the transport or
   forwarding planes.

   Service routes advertised by PE31 that need to resolve over Gold1
   transport tunnels carry a mapping community color:0:101.  In AS3 and
   AS1, where Gold1 is not available, it is mapped to color 100 TRDB
   using a customized resolution scheme.  In AS2, Gold1 is available and
   it maps to color 101 TRDB.

   To facilitate this mapping, every SN/BN in all AS provisioning
   required transport classes, viz. 100, 101 and 102.  SN and BN in AS1
   and AS3 are provisioned with customized resolution schemes that
   resolve routes with transport-target:0:101 or transport-target:0:102
   strictly over color 100 TRDB.

   PE31 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with color 101 for
   endpoint PE31.  This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix RD1:PE31 and
   route target extended community transport-target:0:101.

   At ASBR31, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP CT
   route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB.  ASBR31 is
   provisioned with customized resolution scheme that resolves the
   routes carrying mapping community transport-target:0:101 to resolve
   using color 100 TRDB.  This route is then re-advertised from color
   101 TRDB to ASBR22 with route-target:0:101.

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   At ASBR22, the BGP CT routes received with transport-target:0:101
   will be added to color 101 TRDB and strictly resolve over tunnel
   routes in the same TRDB.  This route is re-advertised to ASBR21 with
   transport-target:0:101.

   Similarly, at ASBR21, the BGP CT routes received with transport-
   target:0:101 will be added to color 101 TRDB and strictly resolve
   over tunnel routes in the same TRDB.  This route is re-advertised to
   ASBR11 with transport-target:0:101.

   At ASBR11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP CT
   route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB.  ASBR11 is
   provisioned with a customized resolution scheme that resolves the
   routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.  This
   route is then re-advertised from color 101 TRDB to PE11 with route-
   target:0:101.

   At PE11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP CT
   route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB.  PE11 is
   provisioned with a customized resolution scheme that resolves the
   routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.

   When PE11 receives the service route with the mapping community
   color:0:101 it directly resolves over the BGP CT route in color 101
   TRDB, which in turn resolves over tunnel routes in color 100 TRDB.

   In doing so, PE11 can forward traffic via tunnels with color 101,
   color 102 in the core domain, and color 100 in the metro domains.

11.3.  Migration Scenarios.

11.3.1.  BGP CT Islands Connected via BGP LU Domain

   This section explains how end-to-end SLA can be achieved while
   transiting a domain that does not support BGP CT.  BGP LU is used in

   In the preceding topology shown in Figure 10, there are three AS
   domains.  AS1 and AS3 support BGP CT, while AS2 does not support BGP
   CT.

   Nodes in AS1, AS2, and AS3 negotiate BGP LU family on IBGP sessions
   within the domain.  Nodes in AS1 and AS3 negotiate BGP CT family on
   IBGP sessions within the domain.  ASBR11 and ASBR21 as well as ASBR22
   and ASBR31 negotiate BGP LU family on the EBGP session over directly
   connected inter-domain links.  ASBR11 and ASBR31 have reachability to
   each other’s loopbacks through BGP LU.  ASBR11 and ASBR31 negotiate
   BGP CT family over a multihop EBGP session formed using BGP LU
   reachability.

   The following tunnels exist for Gold Transport Class

      PE11_to_ASBR11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR11_to_PE11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE31_to_ASBR31_gold - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR31_to_PE31_gold - SRTE tunnel

   The following tunnels exist for Bronze Transport Class

      PE11_to_ASBR11_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR11_to_PE11_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE31_to_ASBR31_bronze - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR31_to_PE31_bronze - SRTE tunnel

   These tunnels are provisioned to belong to Transport Classes Gold and
   Bronze, and are advertised between ASBR31 and ASBR11 with Next hop
   self.

   In AS2, that does not support BGP CT, a separate loopback may be used
   on ASBR22 and ASBR21 to represent Gold and Bronze SLAs, viz.
   ASBR22_lpbk_gold, ASBR22_lpbk_bronze, ASBR21_lpbk_gold and
   ASBR21_lpbk_bronze.

   Furthermore, the following tunnels exist in AS2 to satisfy the
   different SLAs, using per SLA loopback endpoints:

      ASBR21_to_ASBR22_lpbk_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR21_to_ASBR22_lpbk_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

   RD:PE11 BGP CT route is originated from PE11 towards ASBR11 with
   transport-target 'gold.'  ASBR11 readvertises this route with next
   hop set to ASBR11_lpbk_gold on the EBGP multihop session towards
   ASBR31.  ASBR11 originates BGP LU route for endpoint ASBR11_lpbk_gold
   on EBGP session to ASBR21 with a 'gold SLA' community, and BGP LU
   route for ASBR11_lpbk_bronze with a 'bronze SLA' community.  The SLA
   community is used by ASBR31 to publish the BGP LU routes in the
   corresponding BGP CT TRDBs.

   ASBR21 readvertises the BGP LU route for endpoint ASBR11_lpbk_gold to
   ASBR22 with next hop set by local policy config to the unique
   loopback ASBR21_lpbk_gold by matching the 'gold SLA' community
   received as part of BGP LU advertisement from ASBR11.  ASBR22
   receives this route and resolves the next hop over the
   ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_gold RSVP-TE tunnel.  On successful resolution,
   ASBR22 readvertises this BGP LU route to ASBR31 with next hop self
   and a new label.

   ASBR31 adds the ASBR11_lpbk_gold route received via EBGP LU from
   ASBR22 to 'gold' TRDB based on the received 'gold SLA' community.
   ASBR31 uses this 'gold' TRDB route to resolve the next hop
   ASBR11_lpbk_gold received on BGP CT route with transport-target
   'gold,' for the prefix RD:PE11 received over the EBGP multihop CT
   session, thus preserving the end-to-end SLA.  Now ASBR31 readvertises
   the BGP CT route for RD:PE11 with next hop as self thus stitching
   with the BGP LU LSP in AS2.  Intra-domain traffic forwarding in AS1
   and AS3 follows the procedures as explained in Illustration of CT
   Procedures (Section 8)

   In cases where an SLA cannot be preserved in AS2 because SLA specific
   tunnels and loopbacks don't exist in AS2, traffic can be carried over
   available SLAs (e.g.: best effort SLA) by rewriting the next hop to
   ASBR21 loopback assigned to the available SLA.  This eases migration
   in case of heterogeneous color domains as-well.

   family.

11.3.2.1.  Interop Between MPLS and SRv6 Nodes.

   BGP speakers may carry MPLS label and SRv6 SID in BGP CT SAFI 76 for
   AFIs 1 or 2 routes using protocol encoding as described in Carrying
   Multiple Encapsulation information (Section 6.3)

   MPLS Labels are carried using RFC 8277 encoding, and SRv6 SID is
   carried using Prefix SID attribute as specified in Section 7.13.

                         RR1--+
                                \  +-------R2  [MPLS + SRv6]
                                 \ |
                         R1--------P-------R3  [MPLS only]
                   [MPLS + SRv6]   |
                                   +-------R4  [SRv6 only]

                     <---- Bidirectional Traffic ---->

           Figure 11: BGP CT Interop between MPLS and SRv6 nodes

   This example shows a provider network with a mix of devices with
   different forwarding capabilities.  R1 and R2 support forwarding both
   MPLS and SRv6 packets.  R3 supports forwarding MPLS packets only.  R4
   supports forwarding SRv6 packets only.  All these nodes have BGP
   session with Route Reflector RR1 which reflects routes between these
   nodes with next hop unchanged.  BGP CT family is negotiated on these
   sessions.

   R1 and R2 send and receive both MPLS label and SRv6 SID in the BGP CT
   control plane routes.  This allows them to be ingress and egress for
   both MPLS and SRv6 data planes.  MPLS label is carried using RFC 8277
   encoding, and SRv6 SID is carried using Prefix SID attribute as
   specified in Section 7.13, without Transposition Scheme.  In this
   way, either MPLS or SRv6 forwarding can be used between R1 and R2.

   R1 and R3 send and receive MPLS label in the BGP CT control plane
   routes using RFC 8277 encoding.  This allows them to be ingress and
   egress for MPLS data plane.  R1 will carry SRv6 SID in Prefix-SID
   attribute, which will not be used by R3.  In order to interoperate
   with MPLS only device R3, R1 MUST NOT use SRv6 Transposition scheme
   described in [RFC9252].  The encoding suggested in Section 7.13 is
   used by R1.  MPLS forwarding will be used between R1 and R3.

   R1 and R4 send and receive SRv6 SID in the BGP CT control plane
   routes using BGP Prefix-SID attribute, without Transposition Scheme.
   This allows them to be ingress and egress for SRv6 data plane.  R4
   will carry the special MPLS Label with value 3 (Implicit-NULL) in RFC
   8277 encoding, which tells R1 not to push any MPLS label for this BGP

   CT route towards R4.  The MPLS Label advertised by R1 in RFC 8277
   NLRI will not be used by R4.  SRv6 forwarding will be used between R1
   and R4.

   Note in this example that R3 and R4 cannot communicate directly with
   each other, because they don't support a common forwarding
   technology.  The BGP CT routes received at R3, R4 from each other
   will remain unusable, due to incompatible forwarding technology.

11.3.2.2.  Interop Between Nodes Supporting MPLS and UDP Tunneling

   This section describes how nodes supporting MPLS forwarding can
   interoperate with other nodes supporting UDP (or IP) tunneling, when
   using BGP CT family.

   MPLS Labels are carried using RFC 8277 encoding, and UDP (or IP)
   tunneling information is carried using TEA attribute or the
   Encapsulation Extended Community as specified in [RFC9012].

                         RR1--+
                                \  +-------R2  [MPLS + UDP]
                                 \ |
                         R1--------P-------R3  [MPLS only]
                   [MPLS + UDP]    |
                                   +-------R4  [UDP only]

                     <---- Bidirectional Traffic ---->

      Figure 12: BGP CT Interop between MPLS and UDP tunneling nodes.

   In this example, R1 and R2 support forwarding both MPLS and UDP
   tunneled packets.  R3 supports forwarding MPLS packets only.  R4
   supports forwarding UDP tunneled packets only.  All these nodes have
   BGP session with Route Reflector RR1 which reflects routes between
   these nodes with next hop unchanged.  BGP CT family is negotiated on
   these sessions.

   R1 and R2 send and receive both MPLS label and UDP tunneling info in
   the BGP CT control plane routes.  This allows them to be ingress and
   egress for both MPLS and UDP tunneling data planes.  MPLS label is
   carried using RFC 8277 encoding.  As specified in [RFC9012], UDP
   tunneling information is carried using TEA attribute (code 23) or the
   "barebones" Tunnel TLV carried in Encapsulation Extended Community.
   Either MPLS or UDP tunneled forwarding can be used between R1 and R2.

   R1 and R3 send and receive MPLS label in the BGP CT control plane
   routes using RFC 8277 encoding.  This allows them to be ingress and
   egress for MPLS data plane.  R1 will carry UDP tunneling info in TEA
   attribute, which will not be used by R3.  MPLS forwarding will be
   used between R1 and R3.

   R1 and R4 send and receive UDP tunneling info in the BGP CT control
   plane routes using BGP TEA attribute.  This allows them to be ingress
   and egress for UDP tunneled data plane.  R4 will carry special MPLS
   Label with value 3 (Implicit-NULL) in RFC 8277 encoding, which tells
   R1 not to push any MPLS label for this BGP CT route towards R4.  The
   MPLS Label advertised by R1 will not be used by R4.  UDP tunneled
   forwarding will be used between R1 and R4.

   Note in this example that R3 and R4 cannot communicate directly with
   each other, because they don't support a common forwarding
   technology.  The BGP CT routes received at R3, R4 from each other
   will remain unusable, due to incompatible forwarding technology.

12.  Applicability to Network Slicing

   In Network Slicing, the Network Slice Controller (IETF NSC) is
   responsible for customizing and setting up the underlying transport
   (e.g.  RSVP-TE, SRTE tunnels with desired characteristics) and
   resources (e.g., polices/shapers) in a transport network to create an
   IETF Network Slice.

   The Transport Class construct described in this document can be used
   to realize the "IETF Network Slice" described in Section 4 of
   [TEAS-NS]

   The NSC can use the Transport Class Identifier (Color value) to
   provision a transport tunnel in a specific IETF Network Slice.

   Furthermore, the NSC can use the Mapping Community on the service
   route to map traffic to the desired IETF Network Slice.

13.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes the following requests of IANA.

13.1.  New BGP SAFI

   IANA is requested to assign a new BGP SAFI code for "Classful
   Transport".  Value 76.

   This will be used to create new AFI,SAFI pairs for IPv4, IPv6
   Classful Transport families. viz:

   *  "IPv4, Classful Transport".  AFI/SAFI = "1/76" for carrying IPv4
      Classful Transport prefixes.

   *  "IPv6, Classful Transport".  AFI/SAFI = "2/76" for carrying IPv6
      Classful Transport prefixes.

13.2.  New Format for BGP Extended Community

   IANA is requested to assign a new Format type (Type high = 0xa) of
   Extended Community EXT-COMM [RFC4360] for Transport Class from the
   following registries:

      the "BGP Transitive Extended Community Types" registry, and

      the "BGP Non-Transitive Extended Community Types" registry.

   Please assign the same low-order six bits for both allocations.

   This document uses this new Format with subtype 0x2 (route target),
   as a transitive extended community.  The Route Target thus formed is
   called "Transport Class" route target extended community.

   The Non-Transitive Transport Class Extended community with subtype
   0x2 (route target) is called the "Non-Transitive Transport Class
   route target extended community".

   Taking reference of [RFC7153] , following requests are made:

14.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP SAFI for AFIs 1 and 2 and therefore
   does not change the underlying security issues inherent in the
   existing BGP protocol, such as those described in [RFC4271] and
   [RFC4272].






Vairavakkalai & VenkataramExpires 24 June 2024                 [Page 55]

Internet-Draft        BGP Classful Transport Planes        December 2023


   Mechanisms described in this document follow a "Walled Garden"
   approach to carry routes for loopback addresses in BGP CT family
   (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 or 2/76), which is explicitly configured and
   negotiated between BGP speakers.  This mitigates the risk of
   advertising internal loopback addresses outside the administrative
   control of the provider network.  Furthermore, procedures defined in
   Section 9.1 mitigate the risk of unintended propagation of BGP CT
   routes across Inter-AS boundaries even when BGP CT family is
   negotiated on the EBGP session.

   Additionally, BGP sessions SHOULD be protected using TCP
   Authentication Option [RFC5925] and the Generalized TTL Security
   Mechanism [RFC5082].  To mitigate any risk of manipulating the
   routing information carried within a new SAFI, BGP origin validation
   [RFC6811] and BGPsec [RFC8205] could be used as means to increase
   assurance that the information has not been falsified.

   Using a separate BGP family and new RT (Transport Class RT) minimizes
   the possibility of these routes mixing with service routes.

   If redistributing between SAFI 76 and SAFI 4 routes for AFIs 1 or 2,
   there is a possibility of SAFI 4 routes mixing with SAFI 1 service
   routes.  To avoid such scenarios, it is RECOMMENDED that
   implementations support keeping SAFI 76 and SAFI 4 transport routes
   in separate transport RIBs, distinct from service RIB that contain
   SAFI 1 service routes.

   BGP CT routes distribute label binding using [RFC8277] for MPLS
   dataplane and hence its security considerations apply.

   BGP CT routes distribute SRv6 SIDs for SRv6 dataplanes and hence
   security considerations of Section 9.3 of [RFC9252] apply.  Moreover,
   SRv6 SID transposition scheme is disabled in BGP CT, as described in
   Section 7.13, to mitigate the risk of misinterpreting transposed SRv6
   SID information as an MPLS label.

   As [RFC4272] discusses, BGP is vulnerable to traffic-diversion
   attacks.  This SAFI routes adds a new means by which an attacker
   could cause the traffic to be diverted from its normal path.
   Potential consequences include "hijacking" of traffic (insertion of
   an undesired node in the path, which allows for inspection or
   modification of traffic, or avoidance of security controls) or denial
   of service (directing traffic to a node that doesn't desire to
   receive it).

   In order to mitigate the risk of the diversion of traffic from its
   intended destination, existing BGPsec solution could be extended and
   supported for this SAFI.  The restriction of the applicability of

   this SAFI to its intended well-defined scope limits the likelihood of
   traffic diversions.  Furthermore, as long as the filtering and
   appropriate configuration mechanisms discussed previously are applied
   diligently, risk of the diversion of the traffic is eliminated.

Appendix A.  Extensibility considerations

A.1.  Signaling Intent over PE-CE Attachment Circuit

   It may be desirable to allow a CE device to indicate in the data
   packet it sends what treatment it desires (the Intent) when the
   packet is forwarded within the provider network.

   Section A.10 in BGP MultiNexthop Attribute [MNH]describes some
   mechanisms that enable such signaling.

A.2.  BGP CT Egress TE

   Mechanisms described in [BGP-LU-EPE] also applies to BGP CT family.

   The Peer/32 or Peer/128 EPE route MAY be originated in BGP CT family
   with appropriate Mapping Community (e.g.  transport-target:0:100),
   thus allowing an EPE path to the peer that satisfies the desired SLA.

Appendix B.  Applicability to Intra-AS and different Inter-AS
             deployments.

   As described in BGP VPN [RFC4364] Section 10, in an Option C network,
   service routes (VPN-IPv4) are neither maintained nor distributed by
   the ASBRs.  Transport routes are maintained in the ASBRs and
   propagated in BGP LU or BGP CT.

   Illustration of CT Procedures (Section 8) illustrates how constructs
   of BGP CT work in an inter-AS Option C deployment.  The BGP CT
   constructs: AFI/SAFI 1/76, Transport Class and Resolution Scheme are
   used in an inter-AS Option C deployment.

   In Intra-AS and Inter-AS option A, option B scenarios, AFI/SAFI 1/76
   may not be used, but the Transport Class and Resolution Scheme
   mechanisms are used to provide service mapping.

   This section illustrates how BGP CT constructs work in Intra-AS and
   Inter-AS Option A, B deployment scenarios.

B.1.  Intra-AS usecase

B.1.1.  Topology

                  AS2               ...AS1...               AS3

                203.0.113.21 ---- Traffic Direction ----> 203.0.113.31

                        Figure 13: BGP CT Intra-AS.

   This example in Figure 13 shows a provider network Autonomous system
   AS1.  It serves customers AS2, AS3.  Traffic direction being
   described is CE21 to CE31.  CE31 may request a specific SLA (e.g.
   Gold for this traffic), when traversing this provider network.

B.1.2.  Transport Layer

   AS1 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels between PE11 and PE12.  And LDP
   tunnels for best effort traffic.

   The network has two Transport classes: Gold with transport class id
   100, Bronze with transport class id 200.  These transport classes are
   provisioned at the PEs.  This creates the Resolution Schemes for
   these transport classes at these PEs.

   Following tunnels exist for Gold transport class.

      PE11_to_PE12_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE12_to_PE11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

   Following tunnels exist for Bronze transport class.

      PE11_to_PE12_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE11_to_PE12_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

   These tunnels are provisioned to belong to transport class 100 or
   200.

B.1.3.  Service Layer route exchange

   Service nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate service families (AFI/SAFI 1/128)
   on the BGP session with RR11.  Service helper RR11 reflects service
   routes between the two PEs with next hop unchanged.  There are no
   tunnels for transport-class 100 or 200 from RR11 to the PEs.

   Forwarding happens using service routes at service nodes PE11, PE12.
   Routes received from CEs are not present in any other nodes' FIB in
   the provider network.

   CE31 advertises a route for example prefix 203.0.113.31 with next hop
   self to PE12.  CE31 can attach a Mapping Community Color:0:100 on
   this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA.  Or, PE11 can
   attach the same using locally configured policies.

   Consider, CE31 is getting VPN service from PE12.  The RD:203.0.113.31
   route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE12 with next hop self
   (192.0.2.12) and label V-L1, to RR11 with the Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 attached.  This AFI/SAFI 1/128 route reaches PE11 via
   RR11 with the next hop unchanged as PE12 and label V-L1.  Now PE11
   can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.12 using PE11_to_PE12_gold RSVP TE LSP.

   The IP FIB at PE11 VRF will have a route for 203.0.113.31 with a next
   hop when resolved using Resolution Scheme belonging to the mapping
   community Color:0:100, points to a PE11_to_PE12_gold tunnel.

   BGP CT AFI/SAFI 1/76 is not used in this Intra-AS deployment.  But
   the Transport class and Resolution Scheme constructs are used to
   preserve end-to-end SLA.

                 Figure 14: BGP CT Inter-AS option A.

   This example in Figure 14 shows two provider network Autonomous
   systems AS1, AS2.  They serve L3VPN customers AS3, AS4 respectively.
   The ASBRs ASBR11 and ASBR21 have IP VRFs connected directly.  The
   inter-AS link is IP enabled with no MPLS forwarding.

   Traffic direction being described is CE31 to CE41.  CE41 may request
   a specific SLA (e.g.  Gold for this traffic), when traversing these
   provider core networks.

B.2.2.  Transport Layer

   AS1 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels between PE11 and ASBR11.  And
   LDP tunnels for best effort traffic.  AS2 uses SRTE intra-domain
   tunnels between ASBR21 and PE21, and L-ISIS for best effort tunnels.

   The networks have two Transport classes: Gold with transport class id
   100, Bronze with transport class id 200.  These transport classes are
   provisioned at the PEs and ASBRs.  This creates the Resolution
   Schemes for these transport classes at these PEs and ASBRs.

   Following tunnels exist for Gold transport class.

      PE11_to_ASBR11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR11_to_PE11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE21_to_ASBR21_gold - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR21_to_PE21_gold - SRTE tunnel

   Following tunnels exist for Bronze transport class.

      PE11_to_ASBR11_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR11_to_PE11_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE21_to_ASBR21_bronze - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR21_to_PE21_bronze - SRTE tunnel

   These tunnels are provisioned to belong to transport class 100 or
   200.

B.2.3.  Service Layer route exchange

   Service nodes PE11, ASBR11 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI 1/128)
   on the BGP session with RR11.  Service helper RR11 reflects service
   routes between the PE11 and ASBR11 with next hop unchanged.

   Similarly, in AS2 PE21, ASBR21 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI
   1/128) on the BGP session with RR21, which reflects service routes
   between the PE21 and ASBR21 with next hop unchanged.

   CE41 advertises a route for example prefix 203.0.113.41 with next hop
   self to PE21 VRF.  CE41 can attach a Mapping Community Color:0:100 on
   this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA.  Or, PE21 can
   attach the same using locally configured policies.

   Consider, CE41 is getting VPN service from PE21.  The RD:203.0.113.41
   route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE21 with next hop self
   (203.0.113.21) and label V-L1, to RR21 with the Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 attached.  This AFI/SAFI 1/128 route reaches ASBR21 via
   RR21 with the next hop unchanged as PE21 and label V-L1.  Now ASBR21
   can resolve the PNH 203.0.113.21 using ASBR21_to_PE21_gold SRTE LSP.

   The IP FIB at ASBR21 VRF will have a route for 203.0.113.41 with a
   next hop resolved using Resolution Scheme associated with mapping
   community Color:0:100, pointing to ASBR21_to_PE21_gold tunnel.

   This route is readvertised by ASBR21 on BGP session inside VRF with
   next hop self.  EBGP session peering on interface address.  ASBR21
   acts like a CE to ASBR11, and the previously mentioned process
   repeats in AS1, until the route reaches PE11 and resolves over
   PE11_to_ASBR11_gold RSVP TE tunnel.

   Traffic traverses as IP packet on the following legs: CE31-PE11,
   ASBR11-ASBR21, PE21-CE41.  And uses MPLS forwarding inside AS1, AS2
   core.

   BGP CT AFI/SAFI 1/76 is not used in this Inter-AS Option B

   are used to preserve end-to-end SLA.

203.0.113.31          ---- Traffic Direction ---->         203.0.113.41

                 Figure 15: BGP CT Inter-AS option B.

   This example in Figure 15 shows two provider network Autonomous
   systems AS1, AS2.  They serve L3VPN customers AS3, AS4 respectively.
   The ASBRs ASBR12 and ASBR21 don't have any IP VRFs.  The inter-AS
   link is MPLS forwarding enabled.

   Traffic direction being described is CE31 to CE41.  CE41 may request
   a specific SLA (e.g.  Gold for this traffic), when traversing these
   provider core networks.

B.3.2.  Transport Layer

   AS1 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels between PE11 and ASBR21.  And
   LDP tunnels for best effort traffic.  AS2 uses SRTE intra-domain
   tunnels between ASBR21 and PE22, and L-ISIS for best effort tunnels.

   The networks have two Transport classes: Gold with transport class id
   100, Bronze with transport class id 200.  These transport classes are
   provisioned at the PEs and ASBRs.  This creates the Resolution
   Schemes for these transport classes at these PEs and ASBRs.

   Following tunnels exist for Gold transport class.

      PE11_to_ASBR12_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR12_to_PE11_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE22_to_ASBR21_gold - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR21_to_PE22_gold - SRTE tunnel

   Following tunnels exist for Bronze transport class.

      PE11_to_ASBR12_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      ASBR12_to_PE11_bronze - RSVP-TE tunnel

      PE22_to_ASBR21_bronze - SRTE tunnel

      ASBR21_to_PE22_bronze - SRTE tunnel

   These tunnels are provisioned to belong to transport class 100 or
   200.

B.3.3.  Service Layer route exchange

   Service nodes PE11, ASBR12 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI 1/128)
   on the BGP session with RR13.  Service helper RR13 reflects service
   routes between the PE11 and ASBR12 with next hop unchanged.

   Similarly, in AS2 PE22, ASBR21 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI
   1/128) on the BGP session with RR23, which reflects service routes
   between the PE22 and ASBR21 with next hop unchanged.

   ASBR21 and ASBR12 negotiate AFI/SAFI 1/128 between them, and
   readvertise L3VPN routes with next hop self, allocating new labels.
   EBGP session peering on interface address.

   CE41 advertises a route for example prefix 203.0.113.41 with next hop
   self to PE22 VRF.  CE41 can attach a Mapping Community Color:0:100 on
   this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA.  Or, PE22 can
   attach the same using locally configured policies.

   Consider, CE41 is getting VPN service from PE22.  The RD:203.0.113.41
   route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE22 with next hop self
   (192.0.2.22) and label V-L1, to RR23 with the Mapping Community
   Color:0:100 attached.  This AFI/SAFI 1/128 route reaches ASBR21 via
   RR23 with the next hop unchanged as PE22 and label V-L1.  Now ASBR21
   can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.22 using ASBR21_to_PE22_gold SRTE LSP.

   Next, ASBR21 readvertises the RD:203.0.113.41 route with next hop
   self to ASBR12, with a newly allocated MPLS label, V-L2.  Forwarding
   for this label is installed to Swap V-L1, and Push labels for
   ASBR21_to_PE22_gold tunnel.

   ASBR12 further readvertises the RD:203.0.113.41 route via RR13 to
   PE11 with next hop self 192.0.2.12.  PE11 resolves the next hop
   192.0.2.12 over PE11_to_ASBR12_gold RSVP TE tunnel.

   Traffic traverses as IP packet on the following legs: CE31-PE11,
   PE21-CE41.  And uses MPLS forwarding on ASBR11-ASBR21 link, and
   inside AS1, AS2 core.

   BGP CT AFI/SAFI 1/76 is not used in this Inter-AS Option B
   deployment.  But the Transport class and Resolution Scheme constructs
   are used to preserve end-to-end SLA.

Appendix C.  Why reuse RFC 8277 and RFC 4364?

   RFC 4364 is one of the key design patterns produced by networking
   industry.  It introduced virtualization and allowed sharing of
   resources in service provider space with multiple tenant networks,
   providing isolated and secure Layer3 VPN services.  This design
   pattern has been reused since to provide other service layer
   virtualizations like Layer2 virtualization (VPLS, L2VPN, EVPN), ISO
   virtualization, ATM virtualization, Flowspec VPN.

   It is to be noted that these services have different NLRI encoding.
   L3VPN Service family that binds MPLS label to an IP prefix use RFC
   8277 encoding, and others define different NLRI encodings.

   BGP CT reuses RFC 4364 procedures to slice a transport network into
   multiple transport planes that different service routes can bind to,
   using color.

   BGP CT reuses RFC 8277 because it precisely fits the purpose. viz. In
   a MPLS network, BGP CT needs to bind MPLS label for transport
   endpoints which are IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints, and disambiguate between
   multiple instances of those endpoints in multiple transport planes.
   Hence, use of RD:IP_Prefix and carrying a Label for it as specified
   in RFC 8277 works well for this purpose.

   Another advantage of using the precise encoding as defined in RFC
   4364 and RFC 8277 is that it allows to interoperate with BGP speakers
   that support SAFI 128 for AFIs 1 or 2.  This can be useful during
   transition, until all BGP speakers in the network support BGP CT.

   In future, if RFC 8277 evolves into a typed NLRI, that does not carry
   Label in the NLRI, BGP CT will be compatible with that as-well.  In
   essence, BGP CT encoding is compatible with existing deployed
   technologies (RFC 4364, RFC 8277) and will adapt to any changes RFC
   8277 mechanisms undergo in future.

   This is a more pragmatic approach which leverages the benefits of
   time tested design patterns proposed in RFC 4364 and RFC 8277.
   Moreover, this approach greatly reduces operational training costs
   and protocol compatibility considerations, as it complements and
   works well with existing protocol machineries.  This problem does not
   need reinventing the wheel with brand new NLRI and procedures.

   This is a more pragmatic approach, rather than abandoning time tested
   design pattern like RFC 4364 and RFC 8277, just to invent something
   completely new that is not backward compatible with existing
   deployments.  Overloading RFC 8277 NLRI MPLS Label field with
   information related to non MPLS data plane leads to backward
   compatibility issues.

C.1.  Update packing considerations

   BGP CT carries transport class as an attribute.  This means routes
   that don't share the same transport class cannot be packed into same
   Update message.  Update packing in BGP CT will be similar to RFC 8277
   family routes carrying attributes like communities or extended
   communities.  Service families like AFI/SAFI 1/128 have considerably
   more scale than transport families like AFI/SAFI 1/4 or AFI/SAFI
   1/76, which carry only loopbacks.  Update packing mechanisms that
   scale for AFI/SAFI 1/128 routes will scale similarly for AFI/SAFI
   1/76 routes also.

   Section 6.3.2.1 of [Intent-Routing-Color] suggests scaling numbers
   for transport network where BGP CT can be deployed.  Experiments were
   conducted with this scale to find the convergence time with BGP CT
   for those scaling numbers.  Scenarios involving BGP CT carrying IPv4
   and IPv6 endpoints with MPLS label were tested.  Tests with BGP CT
   IPv6 endpoints and SRv6 SID are planned.

   Tests were conducted with 1.9 million BGP CT route scale (387K
   endpoints in 5 transport classes).  Initial convergence time for all
   cases was less than 2 minutes, This experiment proves that carrying
   transport class information as an attribute keeps BGP convergence
   within acceptable range.  Details of the experiment and test results
   are available in BGP CT Update packing Test Results
   [BGP-CT-UPDATE-PACKING-TEST].

   Furthermore, even in today's BGP LU deployments each egress node
   originates BGP LU route for it's loopback, with some attributes like
   community identifying the originating node or region, and AIGP
   attribute.  These attributes may be unique per egress node, thus do
   not help with update packing in transport layer family routes.

Appendix D.  Scaling using BGP MPLS Namespaces

   This document considers scaling scenario suggested in Section 6.3.2.1
   of [Intent-Routing-Color] where 300K nodes exist in the network with
   5 transport classes.

   This may result in 1.5M transport layer routes and MPLS transit
   routes in all Border Nodes in the network, which may overwhelm the
   nodes' MPLS forwarding resources.

   Section 6.2 of [MPLS-NS] describes how MPLS Namespaces mechanism is
   used to scale such a network.  This approach reduces the number of
   PNHs that are globally visible in the network, thus reducing
   forwarding resource usage network wide.  Service route state is kept
   confined closer to network edge, and any churn is confined within the
   region containing the point of failure, which improves convergence
   also.
