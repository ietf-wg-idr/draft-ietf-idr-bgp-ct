<!--[rfced] We see mention of the "TEAs Network Slices Framework" in
     the Abstract, may we update as follows to clarify the document
     you are mentioning?

Original:
These constructs can be used, for example, to realize the "IETF
Network Slice" defined in TEAS Network Slices framework.


Perhaps:
These constructs can be used, for example, to realize the "IETF
Network Slice" defined in the TEAS Network Slices framework (RFC
9543).

-->

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism referred to as "Intent Driven
      Service Mapping". The mechanism uses BGP to express Intent based
      association of overlay routes with underlay routes having specific
      Traffic Engineering (TE) characteristics satisfying a certain Service
      Level Agreement (SLA). This is achieved by defining new constructs to
      group underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE characteristics into
      identifiable classes (called "Transport Classes" or "TCs"), that overlay routes
      use as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Schemes)
      towards service endpoints. These constructs can be used, for example, to
      realize the "IETF Network Slice" defined in the TEAS Network Slices
      framework (RFC 9543).</t>
      <t>Additionally, this document specifies protocol procedures for BGP
      that enable dissemination of service mapping information in a network
      that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains
      may be administered either by the same provider or by closely
      coordinating providers. A new BGP address family that leverages the procedures described in 
      "BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)" (RFC 4364) and follows the NLRI encoding described in 
      RFC 8277 ("Using BGP to Bind MPLS Labels to Address Prefixes") is defined to enable each advertised underlay route to be
      identified by its class. This new address family is called "BGP Classful
      Transport" (or "BGP CT").</t>
    </abstract>

    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Provider networks typically span across multiple domains where each
      domain can either represent an Autonomous System (AS) or an Interior
      Gateway Protocol (IGP) region within an AS. In these networks, several
      services are provisioned between different pairs of service endpoints
      (e.g., Provider Edge (PE) nodes) that can be either in the same domain
      or across different domains.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC9315" format="default"/> defines "Intent" as:</t>
      <blockquote><t>A set of operational
      goals (that a network should meet) and outcomes (that a network is supposed
      to deliver) defined in a declarative manner without specifying how to achieve
      or implement them.</t></blockquote>
      <t> This document prescribes constructs and procedures
      to realize "Intent" and enable provider networks to forward
      service traffic based on service specific Intent from end-to-end across service
      endpoints.</t>
      <t>The mechanisms described in this document achieve "Intent Driven
      Service Mapping" between any pair of service endpoints by:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Provisioning end-to-end "Intent aware" paths using BGP. For
          example, a low-latency path or a best-effort path.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Expressing a desired Intent. For example, use a low-latency path
          with a fallback to the best-effort path.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Forwarding service traffic "only" using end-to-end "Intent aware"
          paths honoring that desired Intent.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>The constructs and procedures defined in this document apply equally
      to intra-AS and inter-AS (a.k.a. multi-AS) deployments in the style of option A, option B, and
      option C (<xref target="RFC4364" sectionFormat="of" section="10"/>) in
      provider networks.</t>
      <t>Such networks provision intra-domain transport tunnels between a pair
      of endpoints, typically a service node or a border node that service traffic
      traverses through. These tunnels are signaled using various tunneling
      protocols depending on the forwarding architecture used in the domain,
      which can be Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet Protocol
      version 4 (IPv4), or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).</t>
      <t>The mechanisms defined in this document allow different tunneling
      technologies to become TC aware. These can be applied
      homogeneously to intra-domain tunneling technologies used in existing
      brownfield networks as well as new greenfield networks. For clarity,
      only some tunneling technologies are detailed in this document. In some
      examples, only MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) is described.
      Other tunneling technologies have been described in detail in other
      documents (and only an overview has been included in this document). For
      example, the details for Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) are provided in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ct-srv6" format="default"/> and an overview is provided in <xref target="SRv6-Support" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Customers need to be able to express desired Intent to the network,
      and the network needs to have constructs able to enact the customer's
      Intent. The network constructs defined in this document are used to
      classify and group these intra-domain tunnels based on various
      characteristics, like TE characteristics (e.g., low-latency), into
      identifiable classes that can pass "Intent aware" traffic. These
      constructs enable services to signal their Intent to use one or more
      identifiable classes and mechanisms to selectively map traffic onto
      "Intent aware" tunnels for these classes.</t>
      <t>This document introduces a new BGP address family called "BGP
      Classful Transport (BGP CT)", which extends/stitches Intent aware intra-domain
      tunnels belonging to the same class across domain boundaries to
      establish end-to-end Intent aware paths between service endpoints.</t>
      <t><xref target="I-D.hr-spring-intentaware-routing-using-color" format="default"/> describes various use cases and
      applications of the procedures described in this document.</t>
      <t><xref target="Appendix_C" format="default"/> provides an outline of the design
      philosophy behind this specification. In particular, readers who are
      already familiar with one or more BGP VPN technologies may want to
      review this appendix before reading the main body of the
      specification.</t>

Resolution Schemes   Transport Route DB    Transport Class
]]></artwork></artset></figure>

      <t>To achieve end-to-end "Intent Driven Service Mapping", this document
      defines the following constructs and BGP extensions:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>The "Transport Class" construct (see <xref target="tc" format="default"></xref>) to group
          underlay tunnels.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The "Resolution Scheme" construct (see <xref target="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm" format="default"></xref>)
          for overlay routes with Mapping Communities to resolve NH reachability from either one or an ordered set of Transport
          Classes.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>The "BGP Classful Transport" (see <xref target="ct-family" format="default"></xref>)
          address family to extend these constructs to adjacent domains.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t><xref target="ArchOv" format="default"/> depicts the intra-AS and inter-AS
      application of these constructs. Interactions between SN1 and PE11 describe
      the intra-AS usage. Interactions between PE21 and PE11 describe the inter-AS usage.</t>
      <t> The example topology is an inter-AS
      option C network (<xref target="RFC4364" sectionFormat="of" section="10"/>) with two AS domains;
      each domain contains tunnels serving two Intents, e.g., 'low-latency' denoted
      by color 100 and 'high-bandwidth' denoted by color 200. AS1 is an RSVP-TE
      network; AS2 is an SRTE network. BGP CT and BGP LU are transport families
      used between the two AS domains. IP1, IP2, and IP3 are service prefixes
      (AFI/SAFI: 1/1) behind egress PE11.</t>
      <t>PE21, SN11, and PE11 are the SNs in this network. SN11 is an ingress
      PE with intra-domain reachability to PE11. PE21 is an ingress PE with
      inter-domain reachability to PE11.</t>
      <t>The tunneling mechanisms are made "Transport Class" aware. They
      publish their underlay tunnels for a Transport Class into an associated TRDB
      (see <xref target="trdb" format="default"></xref>). In <xref target="ArchOv" format="default"/>, RSVP-TE publishes its underlay tunnels into TRDBs
      created for Transport Classes 100 and 200 at BN11 and SN11 within AS1;
      Similarly, SR-TE publishes its underlay tunnels into TRDBs created for
      Transport Classes 100 and 200 at PE21 within AS2.</t>
      <t>Resolution Schemes are used to realize Intent. A Resolution Scheme is
      identified by its "Mapping Community" and contains an ordered list of
      Transport Classes. Overlay routes carry an indication of the desired
      Intent using a BGP community, which assumes the role of "Mapping Community".</t>
      <t>Egress SN "PE11" advertises service routes with desired  Mapping Community, e.g., color:0:100.</t>
      <t>For the intra-AS case, SN1 maps this intra-AS route on RSVP-TE 
      tunnels with TC ID 100 by using the Resolution Scheme for color:0:100.</t>
      <t>For the inter-AS case, the underlay route in a TRDB is advertised 
      in BGP to extend an underlay tunnel to adjacent domains. A new BGP 
      transport family called "BGP Classful Transport", also known as BGP CT 
      (AFI/SAFIs 1/76, 2/76), is defined for this purpose. BGP CT makes it
      possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same destination address, 
      thus avoiding the need for multiple loopbacks on the eSN.</t>
      <t>The BGP CT address family carries transport prefixes across tunnel
      domain boundaries. Its design and operation are analogous to BGP LU
      (AFI/SAFIs 1/4 or 2/4). It disseminates "Transport Class" information
      for the transport prefixes across the participating domains while
      avoiding the need of per-TC loopback. This is not possible
      with BGP LU without using per-color loopback. This dissemination makes
      the end-to-end network a "Transport Class" aware tunneled network.</t>
      <t>In <xref target="ArchOv" format="default"/>, BGP CT routes are originated at BN11 in
      AS1 with NH "self" towards BN21 in AS2 to extend available RSVP-TE
      tunnels for Transport Classes 100 and 200 in AS1. BN21 propagates these
      routes with NH "self" to PE21, which resolves the BGP CT routes
      over SRTE tunnels belonging to same Transport Class, thus forming a
      BGP CT tunnel for each TC ID at PE21.</t>
      <t>PE21 maps the inter-AS service routes received with color:0:100 from 
      AS1 on BGP CT tunnel with TC ID 100 by using the Resolution Scheme for 
      color:0:100. Note that this procedure is same as that followed by SN1 
      in the intra-AS case.</t>
      <t>The following text illustrates how CT architecture provides tiered
      fallback options at a per-route granularity. <xref target="ArchOv" format="default"/>
      shows the Resolution Schemes in use, which make the following NH
      resolution happen at SN11 (intra-AS) and PE21 (inter-AS) for the service 
      routes of prefixes IP1, IP2, and IP3:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Resolve IP1 NH over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
          Class 100 with fallback to TRDB for best effort.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Resolve IP2 NH over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
          Class 200 with fallback to TRDB for best effort.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Resolve IP3 NH over available tunnels in TRDB for Transport
          Class 100 with fallback to TRDB for Transport Class 200.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>In <xref target="ArchOv" format="default"/>, SN11 resolves IP1, IP2, and IP3
      directly over RSVP-TE tunnels in AS1. PE21 resolves IP1, IP2, and IP3
      over extended BGP CT tunnels that resolve over SR-TE tunnels in AS2.</t>
      <t>This document describes procedures using MPLS forwarding
      architecture. However, these procedures would work in a similar manner
      for non-MPLS forwarding architectures as well. <xref target="SRv6-Support" format="default"/> 
      describes the application of BGP CT over the SRv6 data plane.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="tc" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Transport Class</name>
      <t>Transport Class is a construct that groups transport tunnels offering
      similar SLAs within the administrative domain of a provider network or
      closely coordinated provider networks.</t>
      <t>A Transport Class is uniquely identified by a 32-bit "Transport Class
      ID" that is assigned by the operator. The operator consistently
      provisions a Transport Class on participating nodes (SNs and BNs) in a
      domain with its unique Transport Class ID.</t>
      <t>A Transport Class is also configured with RD and import/export RT
      attributes. Creation of a Transport Class instantiates its corresponding
      TRDB and Resolution Schemes on that node.</t>
      <t>All nodes within a domain agree on a common Transport Class ID
      namespace. However, two cooperating domains may not always agree on the
      same namespace. Procedures to manage differences in Transport Class ID
      namespaces between cooperating domains are specified in <xref target="non-agreeing" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Transport Class ID conveys the Color of tunnels in a Transport Class.
      The terms 'Transport Class ID' and 'Color' are used interchangeably in
      this document.</t>
      <section anchor="tc-te" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Classifying TE Tunnels</name>
        <t>TE tunnels can be classified into a Transport Class based on the TE
        attributes they possess and the TE characteristics that the operator
        defines for that Transport Class. Due to the fact that multiple TE
        tunneling protocols exist, their TE attributes and characteristics may
        not be equal but sufficiently similar. Some examples of such
        classifications are as follows:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, IGP Flex-Algo, SR-TE) that support latency
            sensitive routing.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>RSVP-TE tunnels that only go over admin-group with Green
            links.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE) that offer FRR.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE) that share resources in the network
            based on Shared Risk Link Groups defined by TE policy.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Tunnels (RSVP-TE, SR-TE, BGP CT) that avoid certain nodes in
            the network based on RSVP-TE Explicit Route Object (ERO), SR-TE policy, or BGP policy.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>An operator may configure an SN/BN to classify a tunnel into an
        appropriate Transport Class. How exactly these tunnels are made
        Transport Class aware is implementation specific and outside the scope
        of this document.</t>
        <t>When a tunnel is made Transport Class aware, it causes the Tunnel
        Route to be installed in the corresponding TRDB of that Transport
        Class. These routes are used to resolve overlay routes, including BGP
        CT. The BGP CT routes may be further readvertised to adjacent domains
        to extend these tunnels. While readvertising BGP CT routes, the
        "Transport Class ID" is encoded as part of the Transport Class
        RT, which is a new Route Target extended community defined in <xref target="tc-rt" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>An SN/BN receiving the transport routes via BGP with sufficient
        signaling information to identify a Transport Class can associate
        those tunnel routes with the corresponding Transport Class. For example,
        in BGP CT family routes, the Transport Class RT indicates the
        Transport Class. For BGP LU family routes, import processing based on
        communities or inter-AS source-peer may be used to place the route in
        the desired Transport Class.</t>
        <t>When the tunnel route is received via <xref target="RFC9830" format="default"/> with
        "Color:Endpoint" as the NLRI that encodes the Transport Class as an
        integer 'Color' in its Policy Color field, the 'Color' is mapped to a
        Transport Class during the import processing. The SRTE tunnel route
        for this 'Endpoint' is installed in the corresponding TRDB. The SRTE
        tunnel will be extended by a BGP CT advertisement with NLRI
        RD:EP, Transport Class RT, and a new label. The MPLS swap route
        thus installed for the new label will pop the label and forward the
        decapsulated traffic into the path determined by the SRTE route for
        further encapsulation.</t>
        <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp" format="default"/> extends the Path Computation Element
        Communication Protocol (PCEP) to signal attributes of an SR Policy
        that include Color. This Color is mapped to a Transport Class thus
        associating the SR Policy with the desired Transport Class.</t>
        <t>Similarly, <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-color" format="default"/> extends PCEP to carry
        the Color attribute for its use with RSVP-TE LSPs. This Color is
        mapped to a Transport Class thus associating the RSVP-TE LSP with the
        desired Transport Class.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="trdb" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Transport Route Database (TRDB)</name>
        <t>A TRDB is a logical collection of
        transport routes pertaining to the same Transport Class. In any node,
        every Transport Class has an associated TRDB. Resolution Schemes
        resolve NH reachability for EP using the transport routes within
        the scope of the TRDBs.</t>
        <t>Tunnel EP addresses in a TRDB belong to the provider
        namespace representing the core transport region.</t>
        <t>An implementation may realize the TRDB as a "Routing Table"
        referred to in <xref target="RFC4271" sectionFormat="of" section="9.1.2.1"/>, which is used only for resolving NH
        reachability in the control plane. An implementation may choose a
        different datastructure to realize this logical construct while still
        adhering to the procedures defined in this document. The tunnel routes
        in a TRDB require no footprint in the forwarding plane unless they are

      <name>Resolution Scheme</name>
      <t>A Resolution Scheme is a construct that consists of a specific TRDB
      or an ordered set of TRDBs. An overlay route is associated with a
      Resolution Scheme during import processing based on the Mapping
      Community in the route.</t>
      <t>Resolution Schemes enable a BGP speaker to resolve NH
      reachability for overlay routes over the appropriate underlay tunnels
      within the scope of the TRDBs. Longest Prefix Match (LPM) of the NH is performed within the identified TRDB.</t>
      <t>An implementation may provide an option for the overlay route to
      resolve over less-preferred Transport Classes, should the resolution
      over a primary Transport Class fail.</t>
      <t>To accomplish this, the "Resolution Scheme" is configured with the
      primary Transport Class and an ordered list of fallback Transport
      Classes. Two Resolution Schemes are considered equivalent in Intent if
      they consist of the same ordered set of TRDBs.</t>
      <t>Operators must ensure that Resolution Schemes for a Mapping Community
      are provisioned consistently on various nodes participating in a BGP CT
      network based on desired Intent and Transport Classes available in that
      domain.</t>

        <name>Mapping Community</name>
        <t>A "Mapping Community" is used to signal the desired Intent on an

        overlay route to a "Resolution Scheme" used to resolve the route's
        NH.</t>
        <t>A Mapping Community is a "role" and not a new type of community;
        any BGP Community Carrying Attribute (e.g., Community or Extended
        Community) may play this role in addition to the other roles it may already
        be playing. For example, the Transport Class RT
        plays a dual role: as Route Target and a Mapping
        Community.</t>
        <t>Operator provisioning ensures that the ingress and egress SNs agree
        on the BGP CCA and community namespace to use for the Mapping

        <t>A Mapping Community maps to exactly one Resolution Scheme at
        a receiving BGP speaker. An implementation <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> allow the association of

        <name>Comparison with Other Families Using Encoding from RFC 8277</name>
        <t>AFI/SAFI 1/128 (L3VPN) is a family encoded using <xref target="RFC8277"/> that carries service prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes
        come from the customer namespaces and are contextualized into separate
        user virtual service RIBs called VRFs as per <xref target="RFC4364"/>.</t>
        <t>AFI/SAFI 1/4 (BGP LU) is a family encoded using <xref target="RFC8277"/> that carries
        transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the
        provider namespace.</t>
        <t>AFI/SAFI 1/76 (BGP CT) is a family encoded using <xref target="RFC8277"/> that carries transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes
        come from the provider namespace and are contextualized into separate
        TRDB, following mechanisms similar to <xref target="RFC4364"/> procedures.</t>
        <t>It is worth noting that AFI/SAFI 1/128 has been used to carry
        transport prefixes in "L3VPN inter-AS Carrier's carrier" scenario as
        defined in <xref target="RFC4364" sectionFormat="of" section="10"/>, where BGP LU/LDP
        prefixes in CsC VRF are advertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 towards the
        remote-end client carrier.</t>
        <t>In this document, SAFI 76 (CT) is used instead of reusing SAFI
        128 (L3VPN) for AFIs 1 or 2 to carry these transport routes because it
        is operationally advantageous to segregate transport and service
        prefixes into separate address families. For example, such an approach
        allows operators to safely enable a "per-prefix" label-allocation scheme
        for BGP CT prefixes, typically with a number of routes in
        the hundreds of thousands or less, without affecting SAFI 128 service
        prefixes, which may represent millions of routes at the time of writing.
        The "per-prefix" label-allocation scheme localizes routing churn
        during topology changes.</t>
        <t>Service routes continue to be carried in their existing AFI/SAFIs
        without any change. For example, L3VPN (AFI/SAFI: 1/128 and 2/128),
        EVPN (AFI/SAFI: 25/70 ), Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) (AFI/SAFI: 25/65), or Internet (AFI/SAFI:
        1/1 or 2/1). These service routes can resolve over BGP CT (AFI/SAFI:
        1/76 or 2/76) transport routes.</t>
        <t>A new SAFI 76 for AFI 1 and AFI 2 also facilitates having a
        different distribution path of the transport family routes in a
        network than the service route distribution path. Service routes
        (SAFI 128) are exchanged over an EBGP multihop session
        between ASes with the NH unchanged; whereas BGP CT
        routes (SAFI 76) are advertised over EBGP single-hop sessions with a
        "NH self" rewrite over inter-AS links.</t>
        <t>The BGP CT SAFI 76 for AFI 1 and 2 is conceptually similar to BGP
        LU SAFI 4 in that it carries transport prefixes. The only difference
        is that it also carries in a Route Target an indication of which
        Transport Class the transport prefix belongs to and uses the RD to
        disambiguate multiple instances of the same transport prefix in a BGP
        UPDATE message.</t>

        <t>The egress node of the tunnel, i.e., the tunnel endpoint (EP),
        originates the BGP CT route with RD:EP in the NLRI, a Transport Class RT,
        and the PNH as the EP. This BGP CT route will be resolved over the tunnel
        route in TRDB at the ingress node. When the tunnel is up, the Classful
        Transport BGP route will become usable and get readvertised by the
        ingress node to BGP peers in neighboring domains.</t>
        <t>Alternatively, the ingress node of the tunnel, which is also an
        ASBR/ABR in a tunnel's home domain, may originate the BGP CT route for
        the tunnel destination with RD:EP in the NLRI, attaching a Transport Class
        Route Target that identifies the Transport Class. This BGP CT route is
        advertised to EBGP peers and IBGP peers in neighboring domains.</t>
        <t>This originated route <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be advertised to
        the IBGP core that contains the tunnel. This may be implemented by

        such advertisements is outside the scope of this document.</t>
        <t>A unique RD <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used by the originator of a

            <t>Upon receipt of a BGP CT route with a PNH EP that is not directly
          connected (e.g., an IBGP-route), a Mapping Community (the Transport
          Class RT) on the route is used to decide to which Resolution Scheme
          this route is to be mapped.</t>
            <t>The Resolution Scheme for a Transport Class RT with Transport
          Class ID "C1" contains the TRDB of a Transport Class with same ID.
          The administrator <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> customize the Resolution Scheme for Transport
          Class ID "C1" to map to a different ordered list of TRDBs. If the
          Resolution Scheme for TC ID "C1" is not found, the Resolution Scheme
          containing the Best-Effort TRDB is used.</t>
            <t>The routes in the TRDBs associated with a selected Resolution
          Scheme are used to resolve the received PNH EP. The order of TRDBs
          in the Resolution Scheme is followed when resolving the received
          PNH, such that a route in a backup TRDB is used only when a matching
          route was not found for EP in the primary TRDBs preceding it. This
          achieves the fallback desired by the Resolution Scheme.</t>
            <t>If the resolution process does not find a matching route for the EP
          in any of the associated TRDBs, the received BGP CT route <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
          considered unresolvable. (See <xref target="RFC4271" sectionFormat="of" section="9.1.2.1"/>.)</t>
            <t>The received BGP CT route <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be added to the TRDB corresponding
          to the Transport Class ID "C1" if the TC is provisioned
          locally. This step applies only if the Transport Class RT is
          received on a BGP CT family route. The RD in the BGP CT NLRI prefix
          RD:EP is ignored when the BGP CT route for EP is added to the TRDB
          so that overlay routes can resolve over this BGP CT tunnel route by
          performing a lookup for the EP. Please note that a TRDB is a logical
          database of tunnel routes belonging to the same Transport Class ID;
          hence, it only uses the EP as the lookup key (without RD or TC ID).</t>
            <t>If no Mapping Community is found on a BGP CT route, the Best-Effort Resolution Scheme is used to resolve the route's next hop,
          and the BGP CT route is not added to any TRDB.</t>

        <name>Readvertising BGP CT Route by Border Nodes</name>

            <t>This section describes the MPLS label handling when readvertising
          a BGP CT route with "NH self". When readvertising a BGP
          CT route with "NH self", a BN allocates an MPLS label to
          advertise upstream in the BGP CT NLRI. The BN also installs
          an MPLS route for that label that swaps the incoming label with the
          label received from the downstream BGP speaker (or pops the incoming
          label if the label received from the downstream BGP speaker was
          Implicit NULL). The MPLS route then pushes received traffic to the
          transport tunnel or direct interface that the BGP CT
          route's PNH resolved over.</t>
            <t>The label <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be allocated with "per-prefix" label-allocation
          semantics. The IP prefix in the TRDB context (Transport Class,
          IP prefix) is used as the key to "per-prefix" label allocation.
          This helps in avoiding BGP CT route churn throughout the CT network
          when an instability (e.g., link failure) is experienced in a domain.
          The failure is not propagated further than the BN closest to the
          failure. If a different label-allocation mode is used, the impact on
          end-to-end convergence should be considered.</t>

            <t>The value of the advertised MPLS label is locally significant
          and is dynamic by default. A BN may provide an option to allocate a
          value from a statically provisioned range. This can be achieved
          using a locally configured export policy or via mechanisms such as
          the ones described related to BGP Prefix-SID as described in BGP (see <xref target="RFC8669" format="default"></xref>).</t>

        <t>This example shows a provider MPLS network that consists of two
        ASes, AS1 and AS2, that serve customers AS3 and AS4, respectively.
        The traffic direction being described is from CE41 to CE31. CE31 may request a
        specific SLA (mapped to Gold for this example), when
        traversing these provider networks.</t>

<!-- [rfced] Please confirm the following citation as [RFC9350]
     doesn't appear to use the term "ISIS Flex-Algo" (we note that it
     does contain the term "Flex-Algorithm").

     KV> Yes, "Flex-Algo" is the short form for "Flex-Algorithm".

Current:

   AS2 is further divided into two regions. There are three tunnel
   domains in provider's space: AS1 uses ISIS Flex-Algo [RFC9350]
   intra-domain tunnels. AS2 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels.

        <t>AS2 is further divided into two regions. There are three tunnel
        domains in the provider's space:</t>
	<ul>
	  <li>AS1 uses ISIS Flex-Algo (see<xref target="RFC9350" format="default"></xref>) intra-domain tunnels. </li>
	  <li>AS2 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain
          tunnels.</li>
	</ul>
	<t>MPLS forwarding is used within these domains and on
        inter-domain links.</t>
        <t>The network exposes two Transport Classes: "Gold" with Transport
        Class ID 100 and "Bronze" with Transport Class ID 200. These Transport
        Classes are provisioned at the PEs and the Border nodes (ABRs and ASBRs)
        in the network.</t>
        <t>The following tunnels exist for the Gold Transport Class:</t>

<!--[rfced] Please review the use of a comma in the following
     situations:

a) Between "1" and "128" in the following.  We have seen 1/128 in the
earlier parts of this document: are these different meanings?  This
occurs in more than one place.

KV> Yes it is same. For clarity, changed all occurances to "AFI/SAFIs: 1/1 and 1/128"

Original:

   Service nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate service families (AFI: 1 and SAFIs
   1, 128) on the BGP session with RR16.

b) Throughout Section 8.3 and elsewhere in the document, we replaced
many commas with "and" as we believe this was the intended meaning.
Please review and let us know any objections.

KV> Seems OK.
-->


        <t>Service nodes PE11 and PE12 negotiate service families (AFI/SAFIs: 1/1 and
        1/128) on the BGP session with RR16. Service helpers RR16 and
        RR26 exchange these service routes with the next hop unchanged over a
        multihop EBGP session between the two ASes. PE25 negotiates service
        families (AFI/SAFIs: 1/1 and 1/128) with RR26.</t>
        <t>The PEs see each other as the next hop in the BGP UPDATE message for the
        service family routes. BGP ADD-PATH send and receive are enabled on
        both directions on the EBGP multihop session between RR16 and RR26 for
        AFI/SAFIs: 1/1 and 1/128. BGP ADD-PATH send is negotiated in the RR to
        PE direction in each AS. This is to avoid the path-hiding service
        routes at the RR, i.e., AFI/SAFI 1/1 routes advertised by both PE11 and
        PE12 or AFI/SAFI 1/128 routes originated by both PE11 and PE12 using
        the same RD.</t>
        <t>Forwarding happens using service routes installed at service nodes
        PE25, PE11, and PE12 only. Service routes received from CEs are not
        present in any other nodes' FIB in the network.</t>
        <t>As an example, CE31 advertises a route for prefix 203.0.113.31 with
        the next hop as itself to PE11 and PE12. CE31 can attach a Mapping Community
        color:0:100 on this route to indicate its request for a Gold SLA. Or,
        PE11 can attach the same using locally configured policies.</t>
        <t>Consider CE31 getting VPN service from PE11. The
        RD1:203.0.113.31 route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE11 with
        the next hop set to itself (192.0.2.11) and label V-L1 to RR16 with the Mapping
        Community color:0:100 attached. RR16 advertises this route with the BGP
        ADD-PATH ID set to RR26, which readvertises to PE25 with the next hop
        unchanged. Now, PE25 can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.11 using transport
        routes received in BGP CT or BGP LU.</t>
        <t>Using BGP ADD-PATH, service routes advertised by PE11 and PE12 for
        AFI/SAFIs: 1/1 and 1/128 reach PE25 via RR16, RR26 with the next hop
        unchanged, as PE11 or PE12.</t>
        <t>The IP FIB at the PE25 VRF will have a route for 203.0.113.31 with a
        next hop when resolved that points to a Gold tunnel in the ingress
        domain.</t>

        <name>Transport Layer Route Propagation</name>
        <t>Egress nodes PE11 and PE12 negotiate a BGP CT family with transport
        ASBRs ASBR13 and ASBR14. These egress nodes originate BGP CT routes for
        tunnel endpoint addresses that are advertised as a next hop in BGP
        service routes. In this example, both PEs participate in Transport
        Classes Gold and Bronze. The protocol procedures are explained using
        the Gold SLA transport plane; the Bronze SLA transport plane is
        used to highlight the path-hiding aspects.</t>
        <t>For Gold tunnels, PE11 is provisioned with Transport Class having TC ID 100, RD value
        192.0.2.11:100, and a transport-target:0:100. For Bronze tunnels, PE11 is provisioned with
        Transport Class 200, RD value 192.0.2.11:200, and transport-target:0:200.
        Similarly, for Gold tunnels, PE12 is provisioned with
        Transport Class having TC ID 100, RD value 192.0.2.12:100, and a
        transport-target:0:100. For Bronze tunnels, PE12 is provisioned with Transport Class having TC ID 200, RD
        value 192.0.2.12:200, and transport-target:0:200.
        Note that, in this example, the BGP CT routes carry only the Transport
        Class RT and no IP address format route target.</t>
        <t>The RD value originated by an egress node is not modified by any
        BGP speakers when the route is readvertised to the ingress node. Thus,
        the RD can be used to identify the originator (unique RD provisioned)
        or set of originators (RD reused on multiple nodes).</t>
        <t>Similarly, these Transport Classes are also configured on ASBRs,
        ABRs, and PEs with same Transport Class RT and unique RDs.</t>
        <t>ASBR13 and ASBR14 negotiate BGP CT family with transport ASBRs
        ASBR21 and ASBR22 in neighboring ASes. ASBR21 and ASBR22 negotiate BGP CT
        family with RR27 in region 2, which reflects BGP CT routes to ABR23 and
        ABR24. ABR23 and ABR24 negotiate BGP CT family with ingress node PE25 in
        region 1. The BGP LU family is also negotiated on these sessions alongside the
        BGP CT family. The BGP LU family carries Best-Effort Transport Class routes;
        BGP CT carries Gold and Bronze Transport Class routes.</t>
        <t>PE11 is provisioned to originate a BGP CT route for endpoint PE11,
        with a Gold SLA. This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix
        192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11, Label B-L0, next hop 192.0.2.11, and a Route
        Target extended community transport-target:0:100. Label B-L0 can
        either be Implicit NULL (Label 3) or a UHP label.</t>
        <t>This route is received by ASBR13 and it resolves over the tunnel
        ASBR13_to_PE11_gold. The route is then readvertised by ASBR13 in BGP
        CT family to ASBRs ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy. This
        route is sent with same NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11,
        Label B-L1, the next hop set to itself, and transport-target:0:100. An MPLS swap route
        is installed at ASBR13 for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to
        ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel.</t>
        <t>Similarly, ASBR14 also receives a BGP CT route for
        192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 from PE11, and it resolves over the tunnel
        ASBR14_to_PE11_gold. The route is then readvertised by ASBR14 in the BGP
        CT family to ASBRs ASBR21 and ASBR22 according to export policy. This
        route is sent with the same NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11,
        Label B-L2, next hop set to itself, and transport-target:0:100. An MPLS swap route
        is installed at ASBR14 for B-L1 with a next hop pointing to
        ASBR14_to_PE11_gold tunnel.</t>
        <t>In the Bronze plane, the BGP CT route with a Bronze SLA to endpoint PE11
        is originated by PE11 with an NLRI containing RD prefix
        192.0.2.11:200:192.0.2.11 and an appropriate label. The use of distinct
        RDs for Gold and Bronze allows both Gold and Bronze advertisements to
        traverse path-selection pinch points without any path hiding at RRs or
        ASBRs. And Route Target extended community transport-target:0:200 lets
        the route resolve over Bronze tunnels in the network, similar to the
        process being described for the Gold SLA path.</t>
        <t>Moving back to the Gold plane, ASBR21 receives the Gold SLA BGP CT
        routes for NLRI RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 over the single-hop
        EBGP sessions from ASBR13 and ASBR14 and can compute ECMP/FRR
        towards them. ASBR21 readvertises the BGP CT route for
        192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 with a next hop set to itself (loopback address
        192.0.2.21) to RR27, advertising a new label: B-L3. An MPLS swap route
        is installed for label B-L3 at ASBR21 to swap to received labels B-L1 and
        B-L2 and forward to ASBR13 and ASBR14 respectively; this is an ECMP
        route. RR27 readvertises this BGP CT route to ABR23 and ABR24 with the label
        and next hop unchanged.</t>
        <t>Similarly, ASBR22 receives BGP CT route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
        over the single-hop EBGP sessions from ASBR13 and ASBR14, and it
        readvertises with the next hop set to itself (loopback address 192.0.2.22) to RR27,
        advertising a new label: B-L4. An MPLS swap route is installed for
        label B-L4 at ASBR22 to swap to received labels B-L1 and B-L2 and forward
        to ASBR13 and ASBR14, respectively. RR27 also readvertises this BGP CT route
        to ABR23 and ABR24 with the label and next hop unchanged.</t>
        <t>BGP ADD-PATH is enabled for the BGP CT family on the sessions between
        RR27 and the ASBRs and ABRs such that routes for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
        with the next hops ASBR21 and ASBR22 are reflected to ABR23 and ABR24
        without any path hiding. Thus, ABR23 is given visibility of both
        available next hops for the Gold SLA.</t>
        <t>ABR23 receives the route with next hop 192.0.2.21 and label B-L3 from
        RR27. The transport-target:0:100 on this route acts as
        the Mapping Community and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the next
        hop using routes in TC 100 TRDB only. ABR23 is unable to find a
        route for 192.0.2.21 in the TC 100 TRDB. Thus, it considers this
        route unusable and does not propagate it further. This prunes ASBR21
        from the Gold SLA tunneled path.</t>
        <t>ABR23 also receives the route with next hop 192.0.2.22 and label B-L4
        from RR27. The transport-target:0:100 on this route
        acts as the Mapping Community and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the
        next hop using routes in TC 100 TRDB only. ABR23 successfully
        resolves the next hop to point to ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel. ABR23
        readvertises this BGP CT route with the next hop set to itself (loopback address
        192.0.2.23) and a new label B-L5 to PE25. A swap route for B-L5 is
        installed by ABR23 to swap to label B-L4 and forward into
        ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.</t>
        <t>PE25 receives the BGP CT route for prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
        with label B-L5, next hop 192.0.2.23, and transport-target:0:100 from
        RR26. It similarly resolves the next hop 192.0.2.23 over transport
        class 100, pushing labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold
        tunnel.</t>
        <t>In this manner, the Gold transport LSP "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" in the
        egress domain is extended by BGP CT until the ingress node PE25 in the
        ingress domain, to create an end-to-end Gold SLA path. MPLS swap
        routes are installed at ASBR13, ASBR22, and ABR23, when propagating the
        PE11 BGP CT Gold Transport Class route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 with
        next hop set to itself towards PE25.</t>
        <t>Thus formed, the BGP CT LSP originates in PE25 and terminates in
        ASBR13 (assuming PE11 advertised Implicit NULL), traversing over the
        Gold underlay LSPs in each domain. ASBR13 uses UHP to stitch the BGP
        CT LSP into the "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" LSP to traverse the last domain,
        thus satisfying Gold SLA end-to-end.</t>
        <t>When PE25 receives service routes from RR26 with next hop
        192.0.2.11 and Mapping Community color:0:100, it resolves over this
        BGP CT route 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11. Thus, pushing label B-L5 and
        pushing as the top label the labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold
        tunnel.</t>

          <t>This section describes how the data plane looks in steady

          <t>CE41 transmits an IP packet with the destination 203.0.113.31. On
          receiving this packet, PE25 performs a lookup in the IP FIB
          associated with the CE41 interface. This lookup yields the service
          route that pushes the VPN service label V-L1, BGP CT label B-L5, and
          labels for PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel. Thus, PE25 encapsulates the IP
          packet in an MPLS packet with labels V-L1 (innermost), B-L5, and top
          label PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel. This MPLS packet is thus
          transmitted to ABR23 using the Gold SLA.</t>
          <t>ABR23 decapsulates the packet received on PE25_to_ABR23_gold
          tunnel as required and finds the MPLS packet with label B-L5. It
          performs a lookup for label B-L5 in the global MPLS FIB. This yields
          the route that swaps label B-L5 with label B-L4 and pushes the top
          label provided by ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel. Thus, ABR23 transmits
          the MPLS packet with label B-L4 to ASBR22 on a tunnel that
          satisfies the Gold SLA.</t>
          <t>ASBR22 similarly performs a lookup for label B-L4 in the global MPLS
          FIB, finds the route that swaps label B-L4 with label B-L2, and
          forwards it to ASBR13 over the directly connected MPLS-enabled
          interface. This interface is a common resource not dedicated to any
          specific Transport Class, in this example.</t>
          <t>ASBR13 receives the MPLS packet with label B-L2 and performs a
          lookup in the MPLS FIB, finds the route that pops label B-L2, and pushes
          labels associated with ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel. This transmits
          the MPLS packet with VPN label V-L1 to PE11 using a tunnel that
          preserves the Gold SLA in AS 1.</t>
          <t>PE11 receives the MPLS packet with V-L1 and performs VPN
          forwarding, thus transmitting the original IP payload from CE41 to
          CE31. The payload has traversed path satisfying the Gold SLA

          <t>Assuming the ASBR22_to_ASBR13 link goes down, traffic with
          a Gold SLA going to PE11 will need repair. ASBR22 has an alternate BGP CT
          route for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 from ASBR14. This has been
          preprogrammed in forwarding by ASBR22 as an FRR backup next hop for
          label B-L4. This allows the Gold SLA traffic to be locally repaired
          at ASBR22 without the failure event propagated in the BGP CT
          network. In this case, ingress node PE25 will not know there was a
          failure, and traffic restoration will be independent of prefix scale
          (PIC).</t>

          <t>This section describes how the data plane reacts when a Gold path
          experiences a failure but no alternate path exists.</t>
          <t>Assume tunnel ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold goes down, such that now no
          end-to-end Gold path exists in the network. This makes the BGP CT
          route for RD prefix 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 unusable at ABR23.
          This makes ABR23 send a BGP withdrawal for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11
          to PE25.</t>
          <t>The withdrawal for 192.0.2.11:100:192.0.2.11 allows PE25 to react
          to the loss of the Gold path to 192.0.2.11. Assuming PE25 is
          provisioned to use a Best-Effort Transport Class as the backup path,
          this withdrawal of a BGP CT route allows PE25 to adjust the next hop
          of the VPN service route to push the labels provided by the BGP LU
          route. That repairs the traffic to go via the best-effort path. PE25
          can also be provisioned to use the Bronze Transport Class as the backup
          path. The repair will happen in similar manner in that case
          as well.</t>
          <t>Traffic repair to absorb the failure happens at ingress node
          PE25 in a service prefix scale independent manner (PIC). The repair time will be proportional to time taken for withdrawing 
          the BGP CT route.</t>
          <t>These examples demonstrate the various levels of fail-safe
          mechanisms available to protect traffic in a BGP CT network.</t>

            <t>An egress SN <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> advertise a BGP CT route for RD:eSN with two
          Route Targets: transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; and an RT carrying
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt;, where TC is the Transport Class identifier
          and eSN is the IP address used by the SN as BGP next hop in its service
          route advertisements.</t>
            <t>Note that such use of the IP-address-specific route target
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt; is optional in a BGP CT network. It is
          required only if there is a requirement to prune the propagation of
          the transport route for an egress node eSN to only the set of
          ingress nodes that need it. When only the RT of
          transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; is used, the pruning happens in
          granularity of Transport Class ID (Color), not BGP next hop; a
          BGP CT route will only be advertised into a domain with at least one
          PE that imports its Transport Class.</t>
            <t>The transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; is the new type of route target
          (Transport Class RT) defined in this document. It is carried in the BGP
          extended community attribute (attribute code 16).</t>
            <t>The RT carrying &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt; <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be an IP-address-specific regular RT (attribute code 16), or IPv6-address
          specific RT (attribute code 25). It should be noted that the
          Local Administrator field of these RTs can only carry two octets of
          information; thus, the &lt;TC&gt; field in this approach is
          limited to a 2-octet value. Future protocol extension work is
          needed to define a BGP CCA that can accommodate an IPv4/IPv6 address
          along with a 4-octet Local Administrator field.</t>
            <t>An ingress SN <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> import BGP CT routes with a Route Target carrying
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt;. The ingress SN may learn the eSN values
          by configuration or it may discover them from the BGP next
          hop field in the BGP VPN service routes received from the eSN. A BGP
          ingress SN receiving a BGP service route with a next hop of eSN
          generates an RTC route for Route Target prefix &lt;Origin
          ASN&gt;:&lt;eSN&gt;/[80|176] in order to learn BGP CT transport
          routes to reach eSN. This allows constrained distribution of the
          transport routes to the PNHs actually required by iSN.</t>
            <t>When RTC is in use, as described here, BGP CT routes will be
          constrained to follow the same path of propagation as the RTC
          routes. Therefore, a BN would learn the RTC routes advertised by
          ingress SNs and propagate further. This will allow constraining
          distribution of BGP CT routes for a PNH to only the necessary BNs in
          the network, closer to the egress SN.</t>
            <t>When the path of route propagation of BGP CT routes is the same
          as the RTC routes, a BN would learn the RTC routes advertised by
          ingress SNs and propagate further. This will allow constraining
          distribution of BGP CT routes for a PNH to only the necessary BNs in
          the network, closer to the egress SN.</t>
            <t>This mechanism provides "On-Demand Next Hop" of BGP CT routes,
          which helps with the scaling of MPLS forwarding state at the SN and
          BN.</t>
            <t>However, the amount of state carried in RTC family may become
          proportional to the number of PNHs in the network. To strike a
          balance, the RTC route advertisements for &lt;Origin
          ASN&gt;:&lt;eSN&gt;/[80|176] <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be confined to the BNs in the home
          region of an ingress SN, or the BNs of a super core.</t>
            <t>Such a BN in the core of the network imports BGP CT routes with
          Transport-Target:0:&lt;TC&gt; and generates an RTC route for
          &lt;Origin ASN&gt;:0:&lt;TC&gt;/96, while not propagating the more
          specific RTC requests for specific PNHs. This lets the BN learn
          transport routes to all eSN nodes but confines their propagation to
          ingress SNs.</t>

        <t>The use of RDs also provides an option for signaling forwarding
        diversity within the same Transport Class. An SN can advertise an EP
        with the same Transport Class in multiple BGP CT routes with unique
        RDs.</t>
        <t>For example, unique "RDx:EP1" prefixes can be advertised by an SN
        for an EP1 to different upstream BNs with unique forwarding-specific
        encapsulation (e.g., a Label) in order to collect traffic statistics at
        the SN for each BN. In the absence of an RD, duplicated Transport Class / Color
        values will be needed in the transport network to achieve such use
        cases.</t>
        <t>The allocation of RDs is done at the point of origin of the BGP CT
        route. This can be either an egress SN or a BN. The default RD
        allocation mode is to use a unique RD per originating node for an EP.
        This mode allows for the ingress to uniquely identify each originated
        path. Alternatively, the same RD may be provisioned for multiple
        originators of the same EP. This mode can be used when the ingress
        does not require full visibility of all nodes originating an EP.</t>
        <t>A label is allocated for a BGP CT route when it is advertised with
        the next hop set to itself by an SN or a BN. An implementation may use different
        label-allocation modes with BGP CT. Per-prefix is the recommended label-allocation
        mode as it provides better traffic convergence
        properties than a per-NH label-allocation mode. Furthermore, BGP
        CT offers two flavors for per-prefix label allocation:</t>
	<ul spacing="normal">
	  <li>The first
          flavor assigns a label for each unique "RD, EP".</li>
	  <li>The second flavor
        assigns a label for each unique "Transport Class, EP" while ignoring
          the RD.</li>
	</ul>
        <t>In a BGP CT network, the number of routes at an ingress PE is a
        function of unique EPs multiplied by BNs in the ingress domain that have the
        next hop set to themselves. BGP CT provides flexible RD and label-allocation modes
        to address operational requirements in a multi-domain network. The
        impacts on the control plane and forwarding behavior for these modes
        are detailed with an example in <xref target="CTRouteVis" format="default"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In <xref target="RDLabelVis" format="default"/>, route scale at
        ingress node PE31 is proportional to path diversity in the ingress domain
        (number of ASBRs) and point of origination of the BGP CT route. TE
        granularity at ingress node PE31 is proportional to the number of
        unique CT labels received, which depends on the PP-Mode and the path
        diversity in the ingress domain.</t>
        <t>Deploying unique RDs is strongly <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> because it helps in
        troubleshooting by uniquely identifying the originator of a route and
        avoids path hiding.</t>
        <t>In typical deployments, originating BGP CT routes at the egress node
        (SN) is recommended. In this model, using either an "RD, EP" or "TC, EP"
        Per-Prefix label-allocation mode repairs traffic locally at the
        nearest BN for any failures in the network because the label value
        does not change.</t>
        <t>Originating at BNs with unique RDs induces more routes than when
        originating at egress SNs. In this model, use of the "TC, EP" Per-Prefix
        label-allocation mode repairs traffic locally at the nearest BN for
        any failures in the network because the label value does not
        change.</t>
        <t><xref target="RDLabelVis" format="default"/> demonstrates that
        BGP CT allows an operator to control how much path visibility and
        forwarding diversity is desired in the network for both Unicast and
        Anycast endpoints.</t>

        <name>Coordination Between Domains Using Different Community Namespaces</name>
        <t>Cooperating inter-AS option C domains may sometimes not agree on
        RT, RD, Mapping Community, or Transport Class RT values because of
        differences in community namespaces (e.g., during network mergers or
        renumbering for expansion). Such deployments may deploy mechanisms to
        map and rewrite the Route Target values on domain boundaries using
        per-ASBR import policies. This is no different than any other BGP VPN
        family. Mechanisms used in inter-AS VPN deployments may be leveraged
        with the BGP CT family also.</t>
        <t>A Resolution Scheme allows association with multiple Mapping
        Communities. This minimizes service disruption during renumbering,
        network merger, or transition scenarios.</t>
        <t>The Transport Class RT is useful to
        avoid collision with regular Route Target namespace used by service
        routes.</t>

        shows multiple domains that agree on a color namespace (Agreeing
        Color Domains) and contain tunnels with an equivalent set of colors
        (Homogenous Color Domains).</t>
        <t>However, in the real world, this may not always be guaranteed. Two
        domains may independently manage their color namespaces; these are
        known as Non-Agreeing Color Domains. Two domains may have tunnels with
        unequal sets of colors; these are known as Heterogeneous Color
        Domains.</t>
        <t>This section describes how BGP CT is deployed in such scenarios to
        preserve end-to-end Intent. Examples described in this section use
        inter-AS option C domains. Similar mechanisms will work for inter-AS
        option A and inter-AS option B scenarios as well.</t>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Service Layer Color Management</name>
          <t>At the service layer, it is recommended that a global color
          namespace be maintained across multiple cooperating domains. BGP CT
          allows indirection using Resolution Schemes to be able to maintain a
          global namespace in the service layer. This is possible even if each
          domain independently maintains its own local transport color
          namespace.</t>
          <t>As explained in <xref target="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm" format="default"></xref>, a Mapping Community carried on a service
          route maps to a Resolution Scheme. The Mapping Community values for
          the service route can be abstract and are not required to match the
          transport color namespace. This abstract Mapping Community value
          representing a global service layer Intent is mapped to a local
          transport layer Intent available in each domain.</t>
          <t>In this manner, it is recommended to keep color namespace
          management at the service layer and the transport layer decoupled
          from each other. In the following sections, the service layer agrees
          on a single global namespace.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="non-agreeing" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Non-Agreeing Color Transport Domains</name>
          <t>Non-Agreeing Color Domains require a Mapping Community rewrite on
          each domain boundary. This rewrite helps to map one domain's color
          namespace to another domain's color namespace.</t>
          <t>The following example illustrates how traffic is stitched and SLA
          is preserved when domains don't use the same namespace at the
          transport layer. Each domain specifies the same SLA using different
          color values.</t>

          <t>In the topology shown in <xref target="BGPCT_NON_AGREEING_COLOR_DOMAIN" format="default"/>, we have three Autonomous
          Systems. All the nodes in the topology support BGP CT.</t>

	  <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>In AS1, the Gold SLA is represented by color 100 and Bronze by
          200.</li>
          <li>In AS2, the Gold SLA is represented by color 300 and Bronze by
          400.</li>
          <li>In AS3, the Gold SLA is represented by color 500 and Bronze by
          600.</li>
	  </ul>
          <t>Though the color values are different, they map to tunnels with
          sufficiently similar TE characteristics in each domain.</t>
          <t>The service route carries an abstract Mapping Community that maps
          to the required SLA. For example, service routes that need to
          resolve over Gold transport tunnels carry a Mapping Community
          color:0:100500. In AS3, it maps to a Resolution Scheme containing
          TRDB with color 500; in AS2, it maps to TRDB with color 300;
          and in AS1, it maps to TRDB with color 100. Coordination is needed
          to provision the Resolution Schemes in each domain, as explained
          previously.</t>
          <t>At the AS boundary, the Transport Class RT is rewritten
          for the BGP CT routes. In the previous topology, at ASBR31, the
          transport-target:0:500 for Gold tunnels is rewritten to
          transport-target:0:300 and then advertised to ASBR22. Similarly, the
          transport-target:0:300 for Gold tunnels are rewritten to
          transport-target:0:100 at ASBR21 before advertising to ASBR11. At
          PE11, the transport route received with transport-target:0:100 will
          be added to the color 100 TRDB. The service route received with
          Mapping Community color:0:100500 at PE1 maps to the Gold TRDB and
          resolves over this transport route.</t>
          <t>Inter-domain traffic forwarding in the previous topology works as
          explained in <xref target="CTProc" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>Transport Class RT rewrite requires coordination of color values
          between domains in the transport layer. This method avoids the need
          to rewrite service route mapping communities, keeping the service
          layer homogenous and simple to manage. Coordinating Transport Class
          RT between two adjacent color domains at a time is easier than
          coordinating service layer colors deployed in a global mesh of
          non-adjacent color domains. This basically allows localizing the
          problem to a pair of adjacent color domains and solving it.</t>

        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Heterogeneous Agreeing Color Transport Domains</name>
          <t>In a heterogeneous-domain scenario, it might not be possible to
          map a service layer Intent to the matching transport color, as the
          color might not be locally available in a domain.</t>
          <t>The following example illustrates how traffic is stitched when a
          transit AS contains more shades for an SLA path compared to ingress
          and egress domains. This example shows how service routes can
          traverse through finer shades when available and take coarse shades
          otherwise.</t>

            <t>In this approach, duplicate tunnels that satisfy the Gold SLA are

            colors 101 and 102.</t>
            <t>These tunnels will be installed in TRDBs corresponding to

            <t>Overlay routes received with a Mapping Community (e.g.,
            transport-target or color community) can resolve over these
            tunnels in the TRDB with matching colors by using Resolution
            Schemes.</t>
            <t>This approach consumes more resources in the transport and
            forwarding layer because of the duplicate tunnels.</t>

          <section numbered="true" toc="default" anchor="cust_res_scheme">
            <name>Customized Resolution Schemes Approach</name>
            <t>In this approach, Resolution Schemes in domains AS1 and AS3 are
            customized to map the received Mapping Community (e.g.,
            transport-target or color community) over available Gold SLA
            tunnels. This conserves resource usage with no additional state in
            the transport or forwarding planes.</t>
            <t>Service routes advertised by PE31 that need to resolve over
            Gold1 transport tunnels carry a Mapping Community color:0:101. In
            AS3 and AS1, where Gold1 is not available, it is mapped to color
            100 TRDB using a customized Resolution Scheme. In AS2, Gold1 is
            available, and it maps to color 101 TRDB.</t>
            <t>Similarly, service routes advertised by PE31 that need to
            resolve over Gold2 transport tunnels carry a Mapping Community
            color:0:102. In AS3 and AS1, where Gold2 is not available, it is
            mapped to color 100 TRDB using a customized Resolution Scheme. In
            AS2, Gold2 is available, and it maps to color 102 TRDB.</t>
            <t>To facilitate this, SNs/BNs in all three ASes provision the
            transport classes 100, 101, and 102.  SNs and BNs in AS1 and AS3 are
            provisioned with customized Resolution Schemes that resolve routes
            with transport-target:0:101 or transport-target:0:102 using color
            100 TRDB.</t>
            <t>PE31 is provisioned to originate BGP CT routes with color 101
            for endpoint PE31. This route is sent with an NLRI RD prefix RD1:PE31
            and Route Target extended community transport-target:0:101.</t>
            <t>Similarly, PE31 is provisioned to originate BGP CT routes with
            color 102 for endpoint PE31. This route is sent with an NLRI RD
            prefix RD2:PE31 and Route Target extended community
            transport-target:0:102.</t>
            <t>The following description explains the remaining procedures with
            color 101 as an example.</t>
            <t>At ASBR31, the Route Target role of transport-target:0:101 on this
            BGP CT route gives instruction to add the route to color 101 TRDB. ASBR31
            is provisioned with a customized Resolution Scheme that resolves the
            routes carrying Mapping Community transport-target:0:101 to
            resolve using color 100 TRDB. This route is then readvertised
            from color 101 TRDB to ASBR22 with route-target:0:101.</t>
            <t>At ASBR22, the BGP CT routes received with
            transport-target:0:101 will be added to color 101 TRDB and
            strictly resolve over tunnel routes in the same TRDB. This route
            is readvertised to ASBR21 with transport-target:0:101.</t>
            <t>Similarly, at ASBR21, the BGP CT routes received with
            transport-target:0:101 will be added to color 101 TRDB and
            strictly resolve over tunnel routes in the same TRDB. This route
            is readvertised to ASBR11 with transport-target:0:101.</t>
            <t>At ASBR11, the Route Target role of transport-target:0:101 on this
            BGP CT route gives instruction to add the route to color 101 TRDB. ASBR11
            is provisioned with a customized Resolution Scheme that resolves
            the routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.
            This route is then readvertised from color 101 TRDB to PE11 with
            transport-target:0:101.</t>
            <t>At PE11, the Route Target role of transport-target:0:101 on this BGP
            CT route gives instruction to add the route to color 101 TRDB. PE11 is
            provisioned with a customized Resolution Scheme that resolves the
            routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB.</t>
            <t>When PE11 receives the service route with the Mapping Community
            color:0:101, it directly resolves over the BGP CT route in color
            101 TRDB, which, in turn, resolves over tunnel routes in color 100
            TRDB.</t>
            <t>Similar processing is done for color 102 routes also at ASBR31,
            ASBR22, ASBR21, ASBR11, and PE11.</t>
            <t>In doing so, PE11 can forward traffic via tunnels with color
            101, color 102 in the core domain and color 100 in the metro
            domains.</t>

          <t>Nodes in AS1, AS2, and AS3 negotiate BGP LU family on IBGP

          as ASBR22 and ASBR31 negotiate BGP LU family on the EBGP session
          over directly connected inter-domain links. ASBR11 and ASBR31 have
          reachability to each other's loopbacks through BGP LU. ASBR11

          <t>These tunnels are provisioned to belong to Transport Classes Gold
          and Bronze, and they are advertised between ASBR31 and ASBR11 with the next
          hop set to themselves.</t>
          <t>In AS2, which does not support BGP CT, a separate loopback may be

          <t>The RD:PE11 BGP CT route is originated from PE11 towards ASBR11 with
          transport-target 'gold.' ASBR11 readvertises this route with the next
          hop set to ASBR11_lpbk_gold on the EBGP multihop session towards
          ASBR31. ASBR11 originates a BGP LU route for endpoint ASBR11_lpbk_gold
          on an EBGP session to ASBR21 with a 'gold SLA' community and a BGP LU
          route for ASBR11_lpbk_bronze with a 'bronze SLA' community. The SLA
          community is used by ASBR31 to publish the BGP LU routes in the
          corresponding BGP CT TRDBs.</t>
	  
          <t>ASBR21 readvertises the BGP LU route for endpoint
          ASBR11_lpbk_gold to ASBR22 with the next hop set by local policy config
          to the unique loopback ASBR21_lpbk_gold by matching the 'gold SLA'
          community received as part of BGP LU advertisement from ASBR11.
          ASBR22 receives this route and resolves the next hop over the
          ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_gold RSVP-TE tunnel. On successful resolution,
          ASBR22 readvertises this BGP LU route to ASBR31 with the next hop set to itself
          and a new label.</t>

          <t>ASBR31 adds the ASBR11_lpbk_gold route received via EBGP LU from
          ASBR22 to a 'gold' TRDB based on the received 'gold SLA' community.
          ASBR31 uses this 'gold' TRDB route to resolve the next hop
          ASBR11_lpbk_gold received on the BGP CT route with transport-target
          'gold,' for the prefix RD:PE11 received over the EBGP multihop CT
          session, thus preserving the end-to-end SLA. Now ASBR31 readvertises
          the BGP CT route for RD:PE11 with the next hop set to itself, thus stitching
          with the BGP LU LSP in AS2. Intra-domain traffic forwarding in AS1
          and AS3 follows the procedures as explained in <xref target="CTProc" format="default"></xref>.</t>
          <t>In cases where an SLA cannot be preserved in AS2 because SLA-specific
          tunnels and loopbacks don't exist in AS2, traffic can be
          carried over available SLAs (e.g., best-effort SLA) by rewriting the
          next hop to an ASBR21 loopback assigned to the available SLA. This
          eases migration in case of a heterogeneous color domain as well.</t>

            <t>This example shows a provider network with a mix of devices
            that have different forwarding capabilities. R1 and R2 support
            forwarding both MPLS and SRv6 packets. R3 supports forwarding MPLS
            packets only. R4 supports forwarding SRv6 packets only. All these
            nodes have a BGP session with Route Reflector RR1, which reflects
            routes between these nodes with the next hop unchanged. The BGP CT family
            is negotiated on these sessions.</t>
            <t>R1 and R2 send and receive both MPLS labels and SRv6 SIDs in the
            BGP CT control plane routes. This allows them to be ingress and
            egress for both MPLS and SRv6 data planes. The MPLS label is carried
            using the encoding described in <xref target="RFC8277"/>, and an SRv6 SID is carried using the Prefix-SID
            attribute as specified in <xref target="SRv6-Support" format="default"/> without the 
            Transposition Scheme. In this way, either MPLS or SRv6 forwarding
            can be used between R1 and R2.</t>
            <t>R1 and R3 send and receive an MPLS label in the BGP CT control
            plane routes using the encoding described in <xref target="RFC8277"/>. This allows them to be
            ingress and egress for MPLS data plane. R1 will carry an SRv6 SID in
            the Prefix-SID attribute, which will not be used by R3. In order to
            interoperate with MPLS-only device R3, R1 <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the SRv6
            Transposition Scheme described in <xref target="RFC9252" format="default"/>. The
            encoding suggested in <xref target="SRv6-Support" format="default"/> is used by R1.
            MPLS forwarding will be used between R1 and R3.</t>
            <t>R1 and R4 send and receive SRv6 SIDs in the BGP CT control plane
            routes using the BGP Prefix-SID attribute, without a Transposition
            Scheme. This allows them to be ingress and egress for the SRv6 data
            plane. R4 will carry the special MPLS label with a value of 3
            (Implicit NULL) in the encoding described in <xref target="RFC8277"/>, which tells R1 not to push
            any MPLS label for this BGP CT route towards R4. The MPLS label
            advertised by R1 in an NLRI as described in <xref target="RFC8277"/> will not be used by R4. SRv6
            forwarding will be used between R1 and R4.</t>
            <t>Note that, in this example, R3 and R4 cannot communicate directly
            with each other because they don't support a common forwarding
            technology. The BGP CT routes received at R3 and R4 from each other
            will remain unusable due to incompatible forwarding
            technology.</t>

            supports forwarding UDP tunneled packets only. All these nodes
            have BGP session with Route Reflector RR1, which reflects routes

            The MPLS label is carried using the encoding described in <xref target="RFC8277"/>. As specified in
            <xref target="RFC9012" format="default"/>, UDP tunneling information is carried
            using the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute (attribute code 23) or the "barebones" Tunnel TLV
            carried in Encapsulation extended community. Either MPLS or UDP
            tunnel forwarding can be used between R1 and R2.</t>

            MPLS special label 3 (Implicit NULL) in the encoding described in <xref target="RFC8277"/>,
            which tells R1 not to push any MPLS label for this BGP

        <t>Let PE1 be configured to map DSCP1 to the Gold TC and
        DSCP2 to the Bronze TC. Based on the DSCP received
        on the IP traffic from the CE device, PE1 forwards the IP packet over a
        Gold or Bronze TC tunnel. Thus, the forwarding is not based on just
        the destination IP address but also the DSCP. This is
        known as Class-Based Forwarding (CBF).</t>
        <t>CBF is configured at the PE1 device, mapping the DSCP values to
        respective Transport Classes. This mapping (DSCP peering agreement) is
        communicated to CE devices by out-of-band mechanisms. This allows the
        administrator of CE1 to discover what Transport Classes exist in the
        provider network and which DSCP to encode so that traffic
        is forwarded using the desired Transport Class in the provided
        network. When the IP packet exits the provider network to CE2, PE2
        resets the DSCP based on the DSCP peering agreement with
        CE2.</t>

 <!--[rfced] We had the following questions related to the IANA
      Considerations section:


a) We would like to make sure we understand the structure of the IANA
Considerations section.  Currently, we see:

13.1 and 13.2 - seem to add values to existing registries with some
duplication to later sections (see question c below)

13.2.1-13.2.1.1.2 - all under a heading of "Existing Registries"

13.2.2 - 13.2.2 All under a heading of "New Registries"

13.3 - Adds two code points to an existing registry


Perhaps we could update to something structured along the lines of
updates to existing registries and creation of new ones?

13.  IANA Considerations
13.1. Existing Registries
13.1.1. New BGP SAFI
13.1.2. New Format for BGP Extended Community
13.1.3. Registries for the "Type" Field
13.1.3.1. Transitive Types
13.1.3.2. Non-Transitive Types
13.1.4. MPLS OAM Code Points
13.2. New Registries
13.2.1. Transitive Transport Class Extended Community Sub-Types Registry
13.2.2. Non-Transitive Transport Class Extended Community Sub-Types Registry


With something like the following text in Section 13 itself to
introduce the actions:

This document registers values in existing registries and creates new
registries as described in the following subsections.

NOTE: Please review our question c) below before responding.

Please let us know if this restructuring would be agreeable.

KV> I somewhat like the current organization, which keeps everything
KV> related to extended-communities confined to one section 13.2
KV> The proposed reorg spreads extended-communities related things across
KV> multiple sections (new and existing registries). I would like to keep
KV> the organization follow logical/functional grouping (AF, Extended-community, MPLS-OAM, etc).
KV> So, to clarify the section 13.2.1 actually means 'New Regisstries for Extended-community' only.
KV> would like to leave it as-is.

b) Please note that we have updated the capitalization (to lowercase)
of the values in Tables 4 and 6 to match the use in the corresponding
IANA registries.  Please review and let us know any objections.

KV> That is OK.

c) Section 13.2 made us expect that 0xa would be registered in both
the "BGP Transitive Extended Community Types" registry and the "BGP
Non-Transitive Extended Community Types" registry.

KV> No, the non-transitive types are ORed with 0x40. Hence the value 0x4a.

However, we do not see a registration of 0xa in the "BGP
Non-Transitive Extended Community Types" registry at
https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities/bgp-extended-communities.xhtml#non-transitive.

We do see an entry for "0x4a" for "Non-Transitive Transport Class",
that is mentioned in the current Section 13.2.1.1.2.

Please review this section for accuracy and redundancy with Sections
13.2.1.1.1 and 13.2.1.1.2 and let us know if/how we may update (or if
we are just missing something on our end?).

KV> So this looks OK as-is.

d) Section 13.2 says:

Taking reference of [RFC7153] , the following assignments have been
made:

As none of the new entries in the registries list RFC 7153 as a
reference themselves, should this text instead read:

The registries below each reference RFC 7153.

KV> RFC 7153 just provides guidance on how IANA registry for extended communities
KV> need to be updated when adding new extended-communities. So here we are saying
KV> as per that guidance, this section provides the details.

Or is there another way to rephrase?

KV> May be we could rephrase it to:
KV> "Following [RFC7153], the assignments in below subsections have been made."

e) FYI - Any updates made to text that appears in IANA registries will
be communicated by the RPC to IANA upon the completion of AUTH48.

KV> Ack.

        <t>This RFC documents the "Transport Class ID" registry and its assigned values.  The value ranges in this registry are either assigned by this document or reserved for Private Use.  Because the registry is complete, it is being published in this RFC rather than as an IANA-maintained registry.  However, note that IANA-related terminology <xref target="BCP26" format="default"/> is used here.</t>

	<t>Registry Name: Transport Class ID</t>

	<t>The registration procedures are as follows:</t>

	      <tr><th>Value</th><th>Registration Procedure</th></tr>
	    </thead>
	    <tbody>

	      <tr><td>1-4294967295</td><td>Private Use</td></tr>
	    </tbody>
	  </table>

<t>As shown in the table below, the Transport Class ID value 0 is Reserved to represent the "Best-Effort Transport Class ID".  This is used in the 'Transport Class ID' field of a Transport Class RT that represents the Best-Effort Transport Class.</t>

	    </thead>

        <t>As noted in Sections <xref target="tc" format="counter"/> and <xref
        target="bgp-att" format="counter"/>, 'Transport Class ID' is
        interchangeable with 'Color'. For purposes of backward compatibility
        with usage of a 'Color' field in a Color extended community as specified
        in <xref target="RFC9012" format="default"/> and <xref
        target="RFC9256" format="default"/>, the range 1-4294967295 uses
        'Private Use' as the Registration Procedure.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>This document uses the mechanisms from <xref target="RFC4760" format="default"/> to define new
      BGP address families (AFI/SAFI : 1/76 and 2/76) that carry transport layer
      endpoints. These address families are explicitly configured and
      negotiated between BGP speakers, which confines the propagation scope of
      this reachability information. These routes stay in the part of network 
      where the new address family is negotiated and don't leak out into 
      the Internet. </t>
      <t>Furthermore, procedures defined in <xref target="secure-propagate" format="default"/> mitigate 
      the risk of unintended propagation of BGP CT routes across inter-AS
      boundaries even when a BGP CT family is negotiated. BGP import and export policies 
      are used to control the BGP CT reachability information exchanged across AS boundaries.
      This mitigates the risk of advertising internal loopback addresses outside the 
      administrative control of the provider network. </t>
      <t>This document does not change the underlying security issues inherent
      in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in <xref target="RFC4271" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC4272" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Additionally, BGP sessions <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be protected using the TCP
      Authentication Option <xref target="RFC5925" format="default"/> and the Generalized TTL
      Security Mechanism <xref target="RFC5082" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Using a separate BGP family and new RT (Transport Class RT) minimizes
      the possibility of these routes mixing with service routes.</t>
      <t>If redistributing between SAFI 76 and SAFI 4 routes for AFIs 1 or 2,
      there is a possibility of SAFI 4 routes mixing with SAFI 1 service
      routes. To avoid such scenarios, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that implementations
      support keeping SAFI 76 and SAFI 4 transport routes in separate
      transport RIBs, distinct from service RIB that contain SAFI 1 service
      routes.</t>
      <t>BGP CT routes distribute label binding using <xref target="RFC8277" format="default"/>
      for the MPLS data plane; hence, its security considerations apply.</t>
      <t>BGP CT routes distribute SRv6 SIDs for SRv6 data planes; hence,
      the security considerations of <xref target="RFC9252" sectionFormat="of" section="9.3"/>
      apply. Moreover, the SRv6 SID Transposition Scheme is disabled in BGP CT, as
      described in <xref target="SRv6-Support" format="default"/>, to mitigate the risk of
      misinterpreting transposed SRv6 SID information as an MPLS label.</t>
      <t>As <xref target="RFC4272" format="default"/> discusses, BGP is vulnerable to
      traffic-diversion attacks. This SAFI route adds a new means by which an
      attacker could cause the traffic to be diverted from its normal path.
      Potential consequences include "hijacking" of traffic (insertion of an
      undesired node in the path, which allows for inspection or modification
      of traffic, or avoidance of security controls) or denial of service
      (directing traffic to a node that doesn't desire to receive it).</t>
      <t>In order to mitigate the risk of the diversion of traffic from its
      intended destination, BGPsec solutions (<xref target="RFC8205" format="default"/> and
      Origin Validation <xref target="RFC8210" format="default"/><xref target="RFC6811" format="default"/>) may
      be extended in future to work for non-Internet SAFIs (SAFIs other than
      1).</t>
      <t>The restriction of the applicability of the BGP CT SAFI 76 to its
      intended well-defined scope and utilizing <xref target="RFC8212" format="default"/> limits
      the likelihood of traffic diversions.</t>

          <t>The network has two TCs: Gold with TC ID 100 and Bronze
          with TC ID 200. These TCs

          <t>Service nodes PE11 and PE12 negotiate service families (AFI/SAFI
          1/128) on the BGP session with RR11. Service helper RR11 reflects
          service routes between the two PEs with the next hop unchanged. There
          are no tunnels for Transport Class 100 or 200 from RR11 to the
          PEs.</t>
          <t>Forwarding happens using service routes at service nodes PE11 and
          PE12. Routes received from CEs are not present in any other nodes'
          FIB in the provider network.</t>
          <t>CE31 advertises a route, for example, prefix 203.0.113.31 with the next
          hop set to itself to PE12. CE31 can attach a Mapping Community color:0:100 on
          this route to indicate its request for a Gold SLA. Or, PE12 can
          attach the same using locally configured policies.</t>
          <t>Consider CE31 getting VPN service from PE12. The
          RD:203.0.113.31 route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE12 with
          the next hop set to itself (192.0.2.12) and label V-L1 to RR11 with the Mapping
          Community color:0:100 attached. This AFI/SAFI 1/128 route reaches
          PE11 via RR11 with the next hop unchanged as PE12 and label V-L1.
          Now PE11 can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.12 using the PE11_to_PE12_gold RSVP
          TE LSP.</t>
          <t>The IP FIB at PE11 VRF will have a route for 203.0.113.31 with a
          next hop when resolved using the Resolution Scheme belonging to the
          Mapping Community color:0:100, points to a PE11_to_PE12_gold
          tunnel.</t>
          <t>BGP CT AFI/SAFI 1/76 is not used in this intra-AS deployment. But
          the Transport Class and Resolution Scheme constructs are used to
          preserve end-to-end SLA.</t>

          <t>This example in <xref target="BGPCT_INTERAS_A" format="default"/> shows two
          provider network Autonomous systems AS1, AS2. They serve L3VPN
          customers AS3, AS4 respectively. The ASBRs ASBR11 and ASBR21 have IP
          VRFs connected directly. The inter-AS link is IP enabled with no
          MPLS forwarding.</t>
          <t>Traffic direction being described is CE31 to CE41. CE41 may
          request a specific SLA (e.g., Gold for this traffic), when traversing

          <name>Service Layer Route Exchange</name>
          <t>Service nodes PE11, ASBR11 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI
          1/128) on the BGP session with RR11. Service helper RR11 reflects
          service routes between the PE11 and ASBR11 with next hop
          unchanged.</t>
          <t>Similarly, in AS2 PE21, ASBR21 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI
          1/128) on the BGP session with RR21, which reflects service routes
          between the PE21 and ASBR21 with next hop unchanged.</t>
          <t>CE41 advertises a route for example prefix 203.0.113.41 with next
          hop self to PE21 VRF. CE41 can attach a Mapping Community
          color:0:100 on this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA. Or,
          PE21 can attach the same using locally configured policies.</t>
          <t>Consider, CE41 is getting VPN service from PE21. The
          RD:203.0.113.41 route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE21 with
          next hop self (203.0.113.21) and label V-L1 to RR21 with the Mapping
          Community color:0:100 attached. This AFI/SAFI 1/128 route reaches
          ASBR21 via RR21 with the next hop unchanged as PE21 and label V-L1.
          Now ASBR21 can resolve the PNH 203.0.113.21 using
          ASBR21_to_PE21_gold SRTE LSP.</t>
          <t>The IP FIB at ASBR21 VRF will have a route for 203.0.113.41 with
          a next hop resolved using Resolution Scheme associated with mapping
          community color:0:100, pointing to ASBR21_to_PE21_gold tunnel.</t>
          <t>This route is readvertised with the next hop set to itself by ASBR21 to ASBR11
          on a BGP session in the VRF. The single-hop EBGP session endpoints are
          interface addresses. ASBR21 and ASBR11 act like a CE to each other.
          The previously mentioned process repeats in AS1 until the route
          reaches PE11 and resolves over the PE11_to_ASBR11_gold RSVP TE
          tunnel.</t>
          <t>Traffic traverses as an unlabeled IP packet on the following legs:
          CE31-PE11, ASBR11-ASBR21, PE21-CE41. And it uses MPLS forwarding inside the
          AS1 and AS2 core.</t>
          <t>BGP CT AFI/SAFI 1/76 is not used in this inter-AS option B
          deployment. But the Transport Class and Resolution Scheme constructs
          are used to preserve an end-to-end SLA.</t>

          <t>Service nodes PE11 and ASBR12 negotiate service family (AFI/SAFI
          1/128) on the BGP session with RR13. Service helper RR13 reflects
          service routes between the PE11 and ASBR12 with the next hop
          unchanged.</t>
          <t>Similarly, in AS2 PE22, ASBR21 negotiates service family (AFI/SAFI
          1/128) on the BGP session with RR23, which reflects service routes
          between PE22 and ASBR21 with the next hop unchanged.</t>
          <t>ASBR21 and ASBR12 negotiate AFI/SAFI 1/128 between them and
          readvertise L3VPN routes with the next hop set to themselves, allocating new labels.
          The single-hop EBGP session endpoints are interface addresses.</t>
          <t>CE41 advertises a route, for example, prefix 203.0.113.41 with the next
          hop set to itself to PE22 VRF. CE41 can attach a Mapping Community
          color:0:100 on this route to indicate its request for the Gold SLA. Or,
          PE22 can attach the same using locally configured policies.</t>
          <t>Consider CE41 getting VPN service from PE22. The
          RD:203.0.113.41 route is readvertised in AFI/SAFI 1/128 by PE22 with
          the next hop set to itself (192.0.2.22) and label V-L1 to RR23 with the Mapping
          Community color:0:100 attached. This AFI/SAFI 1/128 route reaches
          ASBR21 via RR23 with the next hop unchanged as PE22 and label V-L1.
          Now ASBR21 can resolve the PNH 192.0.2.22 using ASBR21_to_PE22_gold
          SRTE LSP.</t>
          <t>Next, ASBR21 readvertises the RD:203.0.113.41 route with the next hop
          set to itself to ASBR12 with a newly allocated MPLS label V-L2. Forwarding
          for this label is installed to Swap V-L1, and Push labels for
          ASBR21_to_PE22_gold tunnel.</t>
          <t>ASBR12 further readvertises the RD:203.0.113.41 route via RR13 to
          PE11 with the next hop set to itself, 192.0.2.12. PE11 resolves the next hop
          192.0.2.12 over PE11_to_ASBR12_gold RSVP TE tunnel.</t>
          <t>Traffic traverses as the IP packet on the following legs: CE31-PE11
          and PE21-CE41. And it uses MPLS forwarding on the ASBR11-ASBR21 link and
          inside the AS1-AS2 core.</t>
          <t>BGP CT AFI/SAFI 1/76 is not used in this inter-AS option B
          deployment. But the Transport Class and Resolution Scheme constructs
          are used to preserve an end-to-end SLA.</t>

      <name>Why reuse RFCs 8277 and 4364?</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC4364"/> is one of the key design patterns produced by the networking
      industry. It introduced virtualization and allowed sharing of resources
      in the service provider space with multiple tenant networks, providing
      isolated and secure Layer 3 VPN services. This design pattern has been
      reused since to provide other service layer virtualizations like Layer 2
      virtualization (VPLS, L2VPN, EVPN), ISO virtualization, ATM
      virtualization, and Flowspec VPN.</t>
      <t>It is to be noted that these services have different NLRI encodings.
      The L3VPN service family that binds the MPLS label to an IP prefix uses the encoding described in  <xref target="RFC8277"/>
      and others define different NLRI encodings.</t>
      <t>BGP CT reuses the procedures described in <xref target="RFC4364"/> to slice a transport network into
      multiple transport planes that different service routes can bind to
      using color.</t>
      <t>BGP CT reuses <xref target="RFC8277"/> because it precisely fits the purpose.  That is, in
      an MPLS network, BGP CT needs to bind the MPLS label for transport endpoints,
      which are IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints, and disambiguate between multiple
      instances of those endpoints in multiple transport planes. Hence, use of the
      RD:IP_Prefix and carrying a Label for it as specified in <xref target="RFC8277"/> works
      well for this purpose.</t>
      <t>Another advantage of using the precise encoding as defined in <xref
      target="RFC4364"/> and <xref target="RFC8277"/> is that it allows 
      interoperation with BGP speakers that support SAFI 128 for AFIs 1 or
      2. This can be useful during transition until all BGP speakers in the
      network support BGP CT.</t>
      <t>In the future, if <xref target="RFC8277"/> evolves into a typed NLRI that does not carry
      Label in the NLRI, BGP CT will be compatible with that as well. In
      essence, BGP CT encoding is compatible with existing deployed
      technologies (<xref target="RFC4364"/> and <xref target="RFC8277"/>) and will adapt to any changes mechanisms from <xref target="RFC8277"/>
      undergo in future.</t>
      <t>This approach leverages the benefits of time-tested design patterns
      proposed in <xref target="RFC4364"/> and <xref target="RFC8277"/>. Moreover, this approach greatly
      reduces operational training costs and protocol compatibility
      considerations as it complements and works well with existing protocol
      machinery: this problem does not need a brand
      new NLRI and procedures.</t>
      <t>BGP CT design also avoids overloading the NLRI MPLS label field from <xref target="RFC8277"/>
      with information related to the non-MPLS data plane because it leads to
      backward-compatibility issues.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Update Packing Considerations</name>
        <t>BGP CT carries Transport Class as an attribute. This means routes
        that don't share the same Transport Class cannot be packed into the same
        BGP UPDATE message. Update packing in BGP CT will be similar to family routes from <xref target="RFC8277"/>
        carrying attributes like communities or extended
        communities. Service families like AFI/SAFI 1/128 have considerably
        more scale than transport families like AFI/SAFI 1/4 or AFI/SAFI 1/76,
        which carry only loopbacks. Update packing mechanisms that scale for
        AFI/SAFI 1/128 routes will scale similarly for AFI/SAFI 1/76 routes.
        </t>
        <t><xref section="6.3.2.1" target="I-D.hr-spring-intentaware-routing-using-color" format="default"/> suggests
        scaling numbers for a transport network where BGP CT can be deployed.
        Experiments were conducted with this scale to find the convergence
        time with BGP CT for those scaling numbers. Scenarios involving BGP CT
        carrying IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints with an MPLS label were tested. Tests
        with BGP CT IPv6 endpoints and SRv6 SID are planned.</t>
        <t>Tests were conducted with a 1.9 million BGP CT route scale (387K
        endpoints in 5 TCs). Initial convergence time for all
        cases was less than 2 minutes, which compares favorably with user
        expectation for such a scale. This experiment proves that carrying
        Transport Class information as an attribute keeps BGP convergence
        within an acceptable range. Details of the experiment and test results
        are available in <xref target="BGP-CT-UPDATE-PACKING-TEST" format="default"></xref>.</t>
        <t>Furthermore, even in today's BGP LU deployments, each egress node
        originates a BGP LU route for its loopback, with some attributes like
        community identifying the originating node or region and an AIGP
        attribute. These attributes may be unique per egress node; thus, they do not
        help with update packing in transport family routes.</t>

      <name>Scaling Using BGP MPLS Namespaces</name>
      <t>This document considers the scaling scenario suggested in <xref section="6.3.2.1" target="I-D.hr-spring-intentaware-routing-using-color" format="default"/> where 300K nodes exist in the
      network with 5 TCs.</t>
      <t>This may result in 1.5M transport layer routes and MPLS transit
      routes in all Border Nodes in the network, which may overwhelm the
      nodes' MPLS-forwarding resources.</t>
      <t><xref section="6.2" target="I-D.kaliraj-bess-bgp-mpls-namespaces" format="default"/> describes how MPLS Namespaces
      mechanism is used to scale such a network. This approach reduces the
      number of PNHs that are globally visible in the network, thus reducing
      forwarding resource usage network wide. Service route state is kept
      confined closer to network edge, and any churn is confined within the
      region containing the point of failure, which improves convergence
      also.</t>

<!--[rfced] We had the following questions/comments related to
     abbreviation use throughout the document:

a) Abbreviations that appeared without expansion have been expanded
upon first use following guidance from RFC 7322 ("RFC Style Guide").
Please review these expansions for accuracy.

b) We made some updates to the list of abbreviations in the Terminology
section to match their use in past RFCs.  We also flipped the
expansion of TC-BE for a better 1:1 match between the abbreviation and
the expansion.  Please review carefully and let us know any
objections.

c) We see BN expanded as "Border Node".  Past use in RFCs points to
"Boundary Node".  Please review and let us know if any updates should
be made.

KV> In all our discussions BN has meant 'Border Node'. We can leave it as-is.

d) The term "Labeled ISIS" and the abbreviation "L-ISIS" don't appear
in RFC 8867, and RFC 8867 does not appear in the References section of
this document.  Please review the citation to this RFC in the
Terminology section and let us know if/how to update.

KV> I dont see any reference to RFC8867. It is RFC-8667. May be that was
KV> a typo in above statement.
KV> RFC-8667 defines "Labeled ISIS", so it is the correct reference for L-ISIS.

e) [RFC4684] uses "Route Target (RT) Constrain" rather than "Route
Target Constrain (RTC)".  We do see "Route Target Constraint (RTC)" in
RFC 9125 (when citing RFC 4684).  Please let us know if we should adopt
the same form here (i.e., Route Target Constraint (RTC)).

KV> OK.

f) TC is expanded as Traffic Class in the companion documents
(RFCs-to-be 9830 and 9831).  This document expands it as Transport
Class.  Please review and let us know if we should make this
consistent (see also TC ID and TC-BE).

KV> I see Traffic Class in 9830 is something different(RFC-3032.sec2.1 "Exp" bits field)
KV> TC used in this document should remain as Transport Class.

g) To follow the guidance at
https://www.rfc-editor.org/styleguide/part2/#exp_abbrev, we will
update to have the following abbreviations expanded on first use and
then use the abbreviated form thereafter unless we hear objection:

Transport Class (TC)
Route Target (RT) 
Route Target Constrain (RTC) (see related query above)
Community Carrying Attribute (CCA)
BGP Classful Transport (BGP CT)
Address Family Identifier (AFI)
Route Distinguisher (RD)
Endpoint (EP)
Next Hop (NH)
Transport Route Database (TRDB)
Ingress Service Node (iSN)
Egress Service Node (eSN)
Autonomous System (AS)
Per-Hop Behavior (PHB)

KV> OK.

b) Keeping point a) in mind, please review the names of the
communities and extended communities throughout the document for
consistency.  We see varied use of quotation marks, places where words
may be missing, differences in capitalization, etc.  Examples below:

Transport Class Route Target extended community vs. Transport Class
extended community vs. "Transport Class" extended community (see also
Transport Class Route Target vs. transport-class route-target)

Transport Target Extended community

KV> cleaned up these to "Transport Class Route Target extended community"
KV> in the section defining it and in IANA. And rest of the document,
KV> using "Transport Class RT". Hope that works.

transitive extended community vs. Transitive Extended Community

KV> cleaned up to use lower-case (transitive, non-transitive) in body-text.
KV> Proper-case is used only in section headings, etc.

Non-Transitive Extended Community vs. "Non-Transitive Transport Class"
Route Target extended community vs. Non-Transitive Transport Class
Extended community vs. "Non-Transitive Transport Class route target
extended community" vs. Non-Transitive Transport Class vs.
Non-Transitive version of the Transport Class extended community

KV> at some places like error handling, using Transport Class extended community
KV> instead of Transport Class RT is intentional, for future-proofing.
KV> Cleaned up the rest, as explained above.

Mapping Community vs. Mapping community vs. mapping community

KV> Changed all of them to Mapping Community.

Community vs. community (when used alone; see also communities)

Extended Community vs. extended community (when used alone; see also
extended communities)

KV> I did a pass of the document in current state, dont see these variations.
KV> Proper-case is used in section headings, that is intented.

c) The following terminology seems to use inconsistent marking (i.e.,
capitalization, hyphenation, etc.) throughout the document.  Please
review these instances and consider if/how they may be made uniform:

Resolution Scheme vs. resolution scheme vs. "Resolution Scheme"

Route Target vs. route target


Ingress domain vs. ingress domain

Ingress node vs. ingress node

Ingress PE vs. ingress PE (see also egress)

Intent vs. intent

Inter-AS vs. inter-AS (and Intra-AS vs. intra-AS)

Option C vs. option c (and others like option b etc.)

BGP Classful Transport vs. Classful Transport

Classful Transport BGP route vs. Classful Transport route vs. BGP
Classful Transport family routes

Classful Transport NLRI vs. Classful Transport NLRI Prefix
vs. Classful Transport prefix vs. "Classful Transport" SAFI NLRI

Transport Tunnels vs. transport tunnels

KV> This one refers to the previous definition, hence it is Proper-case.

Transport-target vs. transport-target

transport-target:0:100 vs. transport route target 0:200 vs. route
target "transport-target:0:100" vs. transport class 100 routes


Transport Family vs. Transport family vs. transport family (see also
families)

Transport class vs. transport class vs. Transport Class

"Transport Class ID" field vs. "Transport Class" identifier

Transport Class ID 100 vs. Transport Class 100

KV> Transport Class 100 means a Transport Class with TC ID 100.

Color vs. color vs. 'Color' vs. "Color" (FYI 9830 is using Color)

KV> changed it to 'Color'. Using quotes wherever it refers to field name.

color:0:100500 vs. Color:0:100

Transposition scheme vs. transposition scheme vs. Transposition Scheme

operator vs. Operator

service family vs. Service family

service route vs. Service route

FLEX-ALGO vs. Flex-Algo vs. FlexAlgo

MPLS label vs. MPLS Label

Implicit-NULL vs. Implicit Null vs. Implicit NULL 

special label 3 (Implicit NULL) vs. value 3 (Implicit-NULL)

RD:EP vs. "RD:EP" vs. 'RD:Endpoint' vs. "RD:Endpoint" vs. RD,EP
vs. "RD, EP" (see also RD, RT)

KV> Made them all RD:EP.

gold vs. Gold

bronze vs. Bronze

KV> I see the small case gold/bronze as part of example LSP names only.

d) Terms including "best effort": we have updated these terms to
appear as hyphenated when in attributive position (modifying a noun)
but left them open otherwise.  However, there is variance related to
their quotation, capitalization, etc. remaining.  Please review the
terms and let us know if/how further updates for uniformity may be
made (note: the list below includes our hyphenation changes).

best-effort transport class vs. Best-Effort Transport Class

"Best-Effort" transport class TRDB vs. Best-Effort TRDB vs. TRDB for best effort

"best-effort" transport class routes vs. best-effort transport route 

'Best-effort' SLA vs. best-effort SLA

"Best-Effort Transport Class Route Target" vs. Best-Effort Transport Class Route Target

"Best-Effort" Resolution Scheme vs. Best-effort resolution scheme vs. best-effort resolution scheme



e) Please review the following similar instances and let us know
if/how they should be made uniform.

SAFI 76 (BGP CT)
SAFI 76 "Classful Transport"

KV> Changed these to SAFI 76 (CT)

AFI/SAFI 1/76 (Classful Transport SAFI)

KV> Made this AFI/SAFI 1/76 (BGP CT)
KV> SAFI name is CT (Classful Transport). The Family name is BGP CT (like BGP LU).


AFI/SAFI 1/128 (MPLS-labeled VPN address)
Inet-VPN SAFI 128
SAFI 128 (L3VPN)

f) There are many places in which quotation marks are used that we are
uncertain of their meaning/purpose and they are inconsistent
(appearing sometimes and not others or single quotes in some places
while double or no quotes in others).

Please review the use of quotation marks generally throughout the
document.  We suggest removing quotation marks unless they are
absolutely necessary to convey a specific meaning (e.g., directly
quoting another work).


A few examples below from back-to-back sentences in which quotation
seems to be used inconsistently when used with "Transport Class Route
Target Extended community".  There are many other uses of quotation
marks with many other terms to review.

Original:
These mechanisms are applied to BGP CT routes (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 or 2/76)
using "Transport Class Route Target Extended community".

vs.

A BGP speaker that implements procedures described in this document
and Route Target Constrain [RFC4684] MUST also apply the RTC
procedures to the Transport Class Route Target Extended communities
carried on BGP CT routes (AFI/SAFI: 1/76 or 2/76).


and see the mixed use in this paragraph:

This document also reserves the Non-Transitive version of Transport
Class extended community (Section 13.2.1.1.2) for future use.  The
"Non-Transitive Transport Class" Route Target Extended Community is
not used.  If received, it is considered equivalent in functionality
to the Transitive Transport Class Route Target Extended Community,
except for the difference in Transitive bit flag.

g) Other documents in this cluster do not use quotations around field
names (and RFC-to-be 9830 chose to skip quotes for field names in
AUTH48).

As there is mixed use in this document, would you like to update to
match this convention?  Some examples:

KV> Cleaned up to an extent. Whereever a field name is referred,
KV> I feel using the quotes make it clearer.

KV> DONE_MARKER

"Transport Class ID" field
'Transport Class ID' field
Policy Color field
Next hop Address field
BGP next hop field
Local Administrator field
MPLS Label field
<TC> field
"Type" field
Value field
'Color' field

<!--[rfced] Please review uses of the slash "/" character in text and
     consider whether "and", "or", or "and/or" might be clearer for
     the reader.

  KV> The / is mainly used for AFI/SAFI. I think that is OK, cannot be specified with and/or.
